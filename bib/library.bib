  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The role of biomechanics during the overhead lift has not been widely investigated. This study aimed to evaluate any change in biomechanics between safe minimum and safe maximum overhead lifts during the WorkHab Functional Capacity Evaluation.
METHOD: Thirty healthy participants (age range 18-22 years) were videotaped completing the overhead lift. Images at the beginning (0/3), one-third (1/3), two-thirds (2/3), and end of lift (3/3) were collected for the minimum and safe maximum lifts Measurement of joint angles of the wrist, elbow, shoulder and sagittal spine using Dartfish Prosuite software was completed. Paired t-tests were used to analyse the differences in joint angles between lifts.
RESULTS: Participants' biomechanics changed between the minimum and maximum lifts In comparison to minimum lifts, there was increased wrist ulnar deviation (10.50, 95\% CI 4.39, 16.61, p=0.002), increased shoulder flexion (7.26, 95\% CI 0.50, 14.01, p=0.036), increased thoracic extension (-3.40, 95\% CI -5.36, -1.45, p=0.001), increased lumbar extension (3.75, 95\% CI 1.39, 6.12, p=0.003), and decreased elbow flexion (-11.28, 95\% CI -18.57, -4.00, p=0.004) in the maximum lifts.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide insight into biomechanical changes during the overhead lifting, and support the clinical judgements made by the WorkHab assessor in determining safe maximal lift.},

  abstract = {The rat shoulder animal model has been used previously to study the role of intrinsic injury (modeled as an acute insult to the tendon), extrinsic injury (modeled as external subacromial impingement), and overuse factors on rotator cuff tendinosis. These studies demonstrated that it is possible to produce rotator cuff tendinosis with any one of these factors in isolation. The current study uses the rat shoulder model to study the roles of extrinsic compression, overuse, and overuse in combination with extrinsic compression, on the development of rotator cuff tendinosis. The results of this study demonstrate that the injury created by overuse plus extrinsic compression is greater than the injuries created by overuse or extrinsic compression alone, particularly when important biomechanical variables are considered. While ineffective in causing a change in supraspinatus tendon properties in animals with normal cage activity, extrinsic compression had a significant and dramatic effect when it was combined with overuse activity. Without an additional factor, such as overhead activity, the extrinsic compression alone may be insufficient to cause tendinosis. The results of the present study support the role of multiple factors in the etiology of some rotator cuff injuries.},

  abstract = {The magnitude of failure in voluntary drive after fatiguing contractions of different intensities in men and women is not known. The purpose of this study was to compare the time to task failure and voluntary activation of men and women for a sustained isometric contraction performed at a low and high intensity with the elbow flexor muscles. Nine men and nine women sustained an isometric contraction at 20\% and 80\% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force until task failure during separate sessions. The men had a shorter time to failure than women for the 20\% but not the 80\% MVC task. Voluntary activation was reduced to similar levels for the men and women at the end of the fatiguing contractions but was reduced less after the 80\% MVC task than the 20\% MVC contraction. Twitch amplitude was reduced similarly at task failure for both sexes and to similar levels at termination of the 20\% and 80\% MVC tasks. The rate of change in mean arterial pressure was the main predictor of time to failure for the low-force sustained contraction. These results suggest that women experienced greater muscle perfusion, less peripheral fatigue, and a longer time to task failure than men during the low-force fatiguing contraction. However, the low-force task induced greater central fatigue than the high-force contraction for both men and women. Thus, low-force, long-duration fatiguing contractions can be used in rehabilitation to induce significant fatigue within the central nervous system and potentially greater neural adaptations in men and women.},

Five forms of work organization were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of variables and HCA of workers: low decision latitude with pace constraints, medium decision latitude with pace constraints, low decision latitude with low pace constraints, high decision latitude with pace constraints and high decision latitude with low pace constraints.

  abstract = {Articles describing motor function in five chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions (temporomandibular disorders, muscle tension headache, fibromyalgia, chronic lower back pain, and postexercise muscle soreness) were reviewed. It was concluded that the data do not support the commonly held view that the pain of these conditions is maintained by some form of tonic muscular hyperactivity. Instead, it seems clear that in these conditions the activity of agonist muscles is often reduced by pain, even when this does not arise from the muscle itself. On the other hand, pain causes small increases in the level of activity of the antagonist. As a consequence of these changes, force production and the range and velocity of movement of the affected body part are often reduced. To explain how such changes in the behaviour come about, we propose a neurophysiological model based on the phasic modulation of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons supplied by high-threshold sensory afferents. We suggest that the "dysfunction" that is characteristic of several types of chronic musculoskeletal pain is a normal protective adaptation and is not a cause of pain.},

The model is used as a framework for discussing the development of work-related muscle, tendon, and nerve disorders. It is intended as a beginning, to be modified to explain new findings as they become available. In research, it can help to identify areas needing additional data for the development and expression of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Researchers can use it to design laboratory and field studies. In practice, it demonstrates the relationship between common exposure factors and different responses.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss the literature on control and function of multiple muscle systems with special focus on shoulder and upper extremity under submaximal conditions.
DESIGN: The paper is a mini review based on 31 studies.
BACKGROUND: Control mechanisms underlying the recruitment and gradation of muscle activity in complex multiple muscle systems during various voluntary exertions is still not fully understood. Load sharing principles may be influenced by several factors like work demand, fatigability, metabolic factors etc.
METHODS: Several methods, e.g., electromyography, intramuscular pressure, and tissue oxygenation are used. The definition of fatigue is discussed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A relatively fixed load sharing of the shoulder muscles has been found at low load levels, submaximal speeds and with a limited range of movements of the arms for healthy subjects. However, the load sharing of the shoulder muscles can be changed to some extent in response to fatigue, mental demands, visual feedback and in patients suffering from disorders in the upper extremities. It is hypothesized that lack of ability to redistribute muscle activation pattern in the shoulder region or the upper extremity increases the risk of development of work related symptoms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It was the objective of this study to investigate the kinematic and kinetic effects of two specific handling factors that differentiate expert and novice workers, namely the level of knee flexion and box tilt. DESIGN: Seven inexperienced subjects were required to lift a 12-kg box in the sagittal plane using three different strategies: (1) reduced knee flexion and a backward box tilt (more typical of experts); (2) large knee flexion and a backward box tilt; (3) large knee flexion and no box tilt (more typical of novices). BACKGROUND: The lifting techniques of highly skilled workers differ substantially from those of novices but only limited information is available to compare their biomechanical differences. METHODS: The methods included dynamic segmental analyses to calculate the net moments at all body joints and a planar single-muscle equivalent to estimate compression loadings at L5/S1; total work and joint work distribution were calculated using the integration of joint power. The 3-D kinematic data were acquired with three video cameras and force data were obtained with one AMTI force platform which were synchronized with the film data. RESULTS: Box tilt reduced the load trajectory and loadings on the lower back and shoulders; a reduced knee flexion affected body posture and reduced mechanical work and loadings on all body joints. The combination of these two factors, box tilt and reduced knee flexion, showed added effects for almost all variables. CONCLUSIONS: These two factors proper to experts were, in this context, biomechanically more advantageous.},

  abstract = {This study sought to investigate the normal muscle fibre size and type distribution of the human erector spinae, both in thoracic and lumbar regions, in a group of 31 young healthy male (n = 17) and female (n = 14) volunteers. Two percutaneous muscle biopsy samples were obtained under local anaesthesia, from the belly of the left erector spinae, at the levels of the 10th thoracic and 3rd lumbar vertebrae. Samples were prepared for routine histochemistry for the identification of fibre types. Fibre size (cross-sectional area (CSA) and narrow diameter (ND)) was quantified using computerised image analysis. The mean CSA/ND for each fibre type was greater in the thoracic than the lumbar region, but there was no difference between the 2 regions either for percentage type I (i.e. percentage distribution by number), percentage type I area (i.e. relative area of the muscle occupied by type I fibres) or the ratio describing the size of the type I fibre relative to that of the type II. Men had larger fibres than women, for each fibre type and at both sampling sites. In the men, each fibre type was of a similar mean size, whereas in the women the type I fibres were considerably larger than both the type IIA and type IIB fibres, with no difference between the latter two. In both regions of the erector spinae there was no difference between men and women for the proportion (\%) of a given fibre type, but the percentage type I fibre area was significantly higher in the women. The erector spinae display muscle fibre characteristics which are clearly very different from those of other skeletal muscles, and which, with their predominance of relatively large type I (slow twitch) fibres, befit their function as postural muscles. Differences between thoracic and lumbar fascicles of the muscle, and between the muscles of men and women, may reflect adaptive responses to differences in function. In assessing the degree of any pathological change in the muscle of patients with low back pain, it seems clear that (1) sex cannot be disregarded and (2) 'atrophied' (using the criteria from other muscles) type II fibres are not necessarily abnormal for the erector spinae, particularly in women.},

  abstract = {The problem of the increasingly common shoulder pain syndromes in industry was investigated by biomechanic and epidemiologic methods. Rotator cuff tendinitis constitutes a major problem in people with arduous occupations, i.e., shipyard welders (prevalence ratio, 18.3\%), and steel plateworkers (16.2\%). Static work seems to induce symptoms at an earlier age. The clinical diagnosis was supraspinatus tendinitis. The biomechanic studies confirmed the view that the shoulder muscles are heavily loaded when the arm is elevated. Excessive hand tool mass increases the strain markedly in some muscles, particularly the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus. The hypovascularity of the supraspinatus tendon is then likely to be accentuated by high intramuscular pressure that reduces the blood flow through the muscle. The strain on the supraspinatus muscle in overhead work is an important factor contributing to prolonged shoulder disability. An analysis of the distribution of loads imposed on the shoulder in practical working situations can be based on observations of working postures and external forces.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To investigate the effects of physical work load and job experience on morbidity from musculoskeletal disorders among trailer assembly workers.
METHODS A longitudinal study was carried out in a trailer assembly factory with many new workers employed during the follow up. The sickness absence of 532 workers (160 experienced and 372 new (separately for the first year of employment and from the second year on)) was followed up. Exposure was assessed by job titles, visits, task descriptions, and some direct measurements. The associations between the explanatory variables and sick leave were assessed by log linear models.
RESULTS A higher rate of sick leave due to disorders of the upper limbs was found for new workers compared with experienced ones, especially in the high work load group. Women had a higher rate than men. New male workers in physically strenuous tasks had a high rate of sick leave due to neck and shoulder disorders.
CONCLUSIONS As being unaccustomed to work seems to increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, special attention should be paid to newly employed workers.},

  abstract = {A computer-based model of the knee was used to study forces in the cruciate ligaments induced by co-contraction of the extensor and flexor muscles, in the absence of external loads. Ligament forces are required whenever the components of the muscle forces parallel to the tibial plateau do not balance. When the extending effect of quadriceps exactly balances the flexing effect of hamstrings, the horizontal components of the two muscle forces also balance only at the critical flexion angle of 22 degrees. The calculations show that co-contraction of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles loads the anterior cruciate ligament from full extension to 22 degrees of flexion and loads the posterior cruciate at higher flexion angles. In these two regions of flexion, the forward pull of the patellar tendon on the tibia is, respectively, greater than or less than the backward pull of hamstrings. Simultaneous quadriceps and gastrocnemius contraction loads the anterior cruciate over the entire flexion range. Simultaneous contraction of all three muscle groups can unload the cruciate ligaments entirely at flexion angles above 22 degrees. These results may help the design of rational regimes of rehabilitation after ligament injury or repair.},

The main objective of the study is to estimate the biomechanical loading (in terms of peak compression and shear forces) on the lumbar spine for the selected combinations of limited headroom heights and twisting angles. A three-dimensional dynamic biomechanical model was utilized to assess peak compression and shear forces at the L5/S1 lumbosacral joint. The results indicated that by reducing the headroom height, the participants were forced to stand with their trunks fully flexed forward which, by increasing the mechanical disadvantage at the lumbosacral disc, increased the compression forces. Both compression and shear forces were affected by the increase in twisting angle. The greater the twisting angle, the higher the compression and shear forces. Regression models were developed and validated, which demonstrated high accuracy of predicting the psychophysical and biomechanical lifting capacities.},

  abstract = {A comparison of electromyographic (EMG) activity of muscles between and within subjects, and during separate occasions of testing, requires normalization. The most common way for generating the reference level used for normalizing shoulder EMG data is with a maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MVIC). The purpose of this study was to develop a parsimonious set of standardized tests that generate an MVIC in all the major muscle groups of the shoulder. Twelve muscles of the dominant shoulder of 15 subjects were examined using a combination of surface and intramuscular electrodes during 15 tests. The results indicated that many tests maximally activated more than one muscle simultaneously. Four tests were identified as being sufficient for generating an MVIC in the 12 muscles examined and are recommended as the standard set for normalizing shoulder muscle EMG: abduction 90 degrees with internal rotation ("empty can"), internal rotation in 90 degrees abduction ("internal rotation 90 degrees"), flexion at 125 degrees with scapula resistance ("flexion 125 degrees"), and horizontal adduction at 90 degrees flexion ("palm press"). The use of these shoulder normalization tests will make comparisons between shoulder EMG studies more reliable.},

Twenty subjects simulated an overhead drilling task using a close, middle and far reach position while standing on either a lower or a higher step of a stepladder. Root mean square amplitude (AMP) of EMG activity from the dominant side anterior deltoid, biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles was used to determine muscular load. Digital video was used to determine shoulder joint moment using 2-dimensional static link segment modelling in the sagittal plane. The results demonstrated that, compared to the far reach position, using the close reach position significantly decreased anterior deltoid AMP and biceps brachii AMP and moment, but increased triceps brachii AMP. Compared to the lower step, using the higher step significantly decreased anterior deltoid AMP and triceps AMP and moment, while increasing biceps AMP in the close position. There was no significant change noted in EMG median frequency indicating that fatigue was minimized. Moment increased monotonically with AMP. The findings indicated that workers performing overhead tasks should work close to their body in order to minimize shoulder forces. The implications of this recommendation are discussed.},

However, the three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of these reorganization patterns have never been documented in detail. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of repetitive reaching-induced arm fatigue on the whole-body, 3D biomechanical task characteristics. Healthy subjects (N=14) stood and performed a continuous reaching task (RRT) between two targets placed at shoulder height to fatigue. Whole-body kinematic (Vicon), kinetic (AMTI force platforms) and electromyographic (EMG, Noraxon) characteristics were recorded. Maximal voluntary isometric efforts (MVIE) of the shoulder and elbow were measured pre- and post-RRT. Post-RRT shoulder elevation MVIE was reduced by 4.9+/-8.3\% and trapezius EMG amplitude recorded during the RRT increased by 46.9+/-49.9\% from the first to last minute of the RRT, indicating that arm fatigue was effectively induced. During fatigued reaching, subjects elevated their shoulder (11.7+/-10.5 mm) and decreased their average shoulder abduction angle by 8.3+/-4.4 degrees. These changes were accompanied by a lateral shift of the body's center of mass towards the non-reaching arm. These findings suggest a compensatory strategy to decrease the load on the fatigued shoulder musculature.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different measurements are used to assess shoulder function, including range of motion, strength, functional performance and self-report function. To understand disablement, it is necessary to understand the relationship between impairments and function in persons without shoulder problems. This study was conducted to enhance existing comparative data in subjects without upper extremity pathology, and to assess the relationships between impairments (range of motion, strength) and self-reported or measured function/disability. The impact of age, gender and dominance was determined.
METHODS: Two-hundred ninety-four subjects with unaffected shoulders were recruited. The subjects (mean age: 37 years old) were divided into three subgroups, 18-39, 40-59, and over 60 years of age. During a single session, at least two of the following variables were measured: self-reported function (shoulder disability scales), range of motion, isometric rotational strength, or upper limb functional performance (FIT-HaNSA). Two-way analysis of variance was used to determine, for each variable, the effects of age and gender. The relationship between the outcomes was established using Pearson product correlations.
RESULTS: Men were significantly stronger than women for all age categories. There was an age-related decline in strength in men in the over-60 age category. Significant negative correlations between strength and range of motion were demonstrated (-0.22 $<$r $<$ -0.32). Women had a significantly higher range of motion than men for external rotation in the 40-59 age category. Furthermore, the subjects in the over-60 age category experienced a decrease of range of motion. There was minimal disability reported in all age groups on self-report scales. Only the Simple Shoulder Test demonstrated significant decreases in the over-60 age category and correlated with age (r = -0.202).
CONCLUSION: Self-reported disability was low in individuals without upper extremity problems, although recruitment of such individuals was difficult in the older age groups due to the high prevalence of shoulder pathology. A low correlation between self-report disability and strength/range of motion in these unaffected subjects reflects the lack of disability reported by all subjects without pathology despite normal variations in strength and motion.},

  abstract = {Over-pronation has been cited as a key contributor to many types of running injuries. However, the roles of the extrinsic foot muscles during running have not been adequately identified. The purpose of this study was to examine the muscle functional (mf) MRI and EMG responses to perturbations of the foot by running in varus, neutral and valgus wedged shoes. Ten males ran at 3.6 m/s in specially constructed shoes for 5 min with T2-weighted mfMRI collected before and after each run. The change in T2 from before to after each run characterized the level of metabolic activity in each of muscle. Kinematic and EMG data were also collected while subjects ran on a treadmill. There were no T2 differences across the three shoe conditions. In contrast, there was significantly less EMG activity in the tibialis anterior and soleus while wearing the neutral shoe. Overall, the results did not support the theory that muscle activity would increase as the degree of eversion increased. It also appears that surface EMG was more sensitive to differences between conditions than mfMRI. However, this study illustrated that mfMRI may be a useful tool for quantifying muscle activity in cases where surface EMG is inadequate.},

  abstract = {This study presents data collected over the past 10 years on the muscle fiber type composition of the vastus lateralis muscle of young men and women. Biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of 55 women (21.2+/-2.2 yr) and 95 men (21.5+/-2.4 yr) who had volunteered to participate in various research projects. Six fiber types (I, IC, IIC, IIA, IIAB, and IIB) were classified using mATPase histochemistry, and cross-sectional area was measured for the major fiber types (I, IIA, and IIB). Myosin heavy chain (MHC) content was determined electrophoretically on all of the samples from the men and on 26 samples from the women. With the exception of fiber Type IC, no significant differences were found between men and women for muscle fiber type distribution. The vastus lateralis muscle of both the men and women contained approximately 41\% I, 1\% IC, 1\% IIC, 31\% IIA, 6\% IIAB, and 20\% IIB. However, the cross-sectional area of all three major fiber types was larger for the men compared to the women. In addition, the Type IIA fibers were the largest for the men, whereas the Type I fibers tended to be the largest for the women. Therefore, gender differences were found with regard to the area occupied by each specific fiber type: IIA$>$I$>$IIB for the men and I$>$IIA$>$IIB for the women. These data establish normative values for the mATPase-based fiber type distribution and sizes in untrained young men and women.},

  abstract = {Tne anatomy of the human trapezius muscle is complex, with an extensive origin and fibers running in different directions. The muscle is commonly divided into three different muscle portions according to the fiber direction: the descending, transverse, and ascending portions. In a previous study in males, the structure of the muscle differed between different portions with respect to the enzyme-histochemical fiber-type profile. The lower regions of the descending portion and the transverse and the ascending portions had a predominance of type I fibers. The type II fibers were more frequent in the upper regions of the descending portion, and the cross-sectional fiber area in this region of the muscle was smaller. In this study, we have investigated the trapezius muscle in females and compared the results with those from males. The different portions of the female muscle had a relatively even fiber-type composition. However, there tended to be fewer type I fibers and more type IIB fibers in the descending portion of the muscle, and the fibers of the lower regions of the descending portion were somewhat larger. The fiber-type distribution pattern was similar to that of the male trapezius muscle, but the mean cross-sectional area of the fibers in the female muscle was considerably smaller. Thus, our conclusion is that the trapezius muscle of females has a similar activity pattern as that of males. The significantly smaller cross-sectional fiber area, however, may indicate a lower functional capacity which may be of importance in the development of neck and shoulder dysfunction in females.},

This chapter reviews how the structure of the neuromusculoskeletal system is commonly represented in a multijoint model of movement, how modeling may be combined with optimization theory to simulate the dynamics of a motor task, and how model output can be analyzed to describe and explain muscle function.

The average of occupational repetitive actions performed by poultry workers was 59.1 $\pm$ 18.0 per minute. The average score of OCRA's checklist was 16.8 $\pm$ 4.2 (moderate risk). The scores for the right upper limb (18.3\textemdash{}moderate risk) were significantly higher (p = 0.003) than the contralateral limb (15.3\textemdash{}moderate risk).

Kinematic motion analysis was performed on 63 asymptomatic volunteers for four different trunk motions. This study has shown that the pelvis range of motion is affected by the gender Contribution of pelvic movement to trunk flexion was 50\%, while pelvic angle was significantly higher in women. During lateral bending female subjects had statistically significant higher values of vertebral arc with respect to male subjects. During extension the contribution of pelvic movement was 45\%.

  volume = {41},
  issn = {0271-3586},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome and low back disorders has been a focus of international prevention efforts including regulation. This study examines workers compensation claims in Washington State to provide baseline data from which to assess the need and the effects of prevention activities.
METHODS: Washington State Fund workers compensation claims for general and selected specific hand/wrist, elbow, shoulder, and back disorders in 1990-1998 as well as general self-insured compensable (four or more lost workdays) claims data were examined. Payroll hours were used to calculate claims incidence rates per 10,000 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). We created a prevention index (PI) to rank industries by averaging the ranks of their number of claims and their claims incidence rate. The focus was on non-traumatic soft tissue musculoskeletal disorders (NTST-MSDs).
RESULTS: Between 1990-1998, there were 392,925 State Fund accepted claims for NTST-MSDs of the neck, back, and upper extremity resulting in \$2.6 billion in direct costs and 20.5 million lost workdays. The average claims incidence rate (CIR) was 355 NTST-MSDs per 10,000 FTEs. The NTST-MSD CIR decreased significantly less than that for all other claims (P = 0.05) but the CIR for upper extremity NTST-MSDs did not significantly decrease over the study period. There were no significant changes in the CIRs for sciatica (4.9 per 10,000 FTEs) and rotator cuff syndrome (15.3 per 10,000 FTEs), whereas the CIR for epicondylitis (10.6 per 10,000 FTEs) increased and for carpal tunnel syndrome (24.5 per 10,000 FTEs) decreased significantly over the study period. Based on the prevention index, the top five industries for combined State Fund and Self-Insured Compensable NTST-MSDs were Trucking and Courier Services (SIC 421), Nursing Homes (SIC 805), Masonry (SIC 174), Air Transportation (SIC 451), and Residential Construction (SIC 152). Using Washington Industrial Classes (WIC), temporary workers in assembly and administrative services were also high on the prevention index.
CONCLUSIONS: NTST-MSDs continue to be a large and costly problem in Washington State. While the incidence rates for some NTST-MSDs are decreasing, the overall rate is not decreasing as fast as the rate for all other claims. In some cases, the rate is stable (sciatica, rotator cuff syndrome) or increasing (epicondylitis). Heavy manual handling and repetitive work characterize the industries with the highest risk.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that bicycle training may improve the relationship between the global SEMG energy and VO2. We already showed close adjustment of the root mean square (RMS) of the surface electromyogram (SEMG) to the oxygen uptake (VO2) during cycling exercise in untrained subjects. Because in these circumstances an altered neuromuscular transmission which could affect SEMG measurement occurred in untrained individuals only, we searched for differences in the SEMG vs. VO2 relationship between untrained subjects and well-trained cyclists. Each subject first performed an incremental exercise to determine VO2max and the ventilatory threshold, and second a constant-load threshold cycling exercise, continued until exhaustion. SEMG from both vastus lateralis muscles was continuously recorded. RMS was computed. M-Wave was periodically recorded. During incremental exercise: (1) a significant non-linear positive correlation was found between RMS increase and VO2 increase in untrained subjects, whereas the relationship was best fitted by a straight line in trained cyclists; (2) the RMS/VO2 ratio decreased progressively throughout the incremental exercise, its decline being significantly and markedly accentuated in trained cyclists; (3) in untrained subjects, significant M-wave alterations occurred at the end of the trial. These M-wave alterations could explain the non-linear RMS increase in these individuals. During constant-load exercise: (1) after an initial increase, the VO2 ratio decreased progressively to reach a plateau after 2 min of exercise, but no significant inter-group differences were noted; (2) no M-wave changes were measured in the two groups. We concluded that the global SEMG energy recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle is a good estimate of metabolic energy expenditure during incremental cycling exercise only in well-trained cyclists.},

With over 87 million work hours, incidence density rates, rate ratios, and confidence intervals are given by age, sex, length of employment, and job-lifting requirements. Injuries are further described by lost work days, activity at time of injury, work restrictions, and time frames. The unadjusted low back injury rate per million work hours was 1.6 times higher for men compared with women, and rates were highest for those less than 25 years of age, those with less than 2 years of current job experience, and employees with the greatest materials lifting and handling job requirements. These findings in unadjusted rates and rate ratios persisted when each was adjusted through a Poisson regression model, with the exception of sex. The adjusted risk ratio for males was reversed with significantly higher risk in females when the rate ratio was adjusted for age, lifting intensity, and length of job experience. Injuries were most commonly associated with lifting activities and, while injury occurrence was highest from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., rates were greatest during those hours when the store was closed to retail activities. Merchandise stocking that requires heavy and frequent materials handling is done during these hours. Fewer injuries than expected were reported on weekends, days with considerably less materials handling activities.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of experimental and chronic neck-shoulder pain on the magnitude of cycle-to-cycle variability of task timing, kinematics and muscle activation during repetitive arm movement performed for 3 or 5 min. In an experimental part, acute muscle pain was induced in healthy subjects by intramuscular injection of hypertonic saline in trapezius (n = 10) and infraspinatus (n = 10) muscles. In a clinical part, workers with (n = 12) and without (n = 6) chronic neck-shoulder pain were compared. Cycle-to-cycle standard deviations of task duration, arm and trunk movement in 3D and surface electromyographic (EMG) root mean square activity were computed to assess the degree of variability. The variability in task timing increased in presence of both experimental and chronic pain (P $<$ 0.05) compared with non-painful conditions. Experimental pain increased the variability of the starting position of the arm (P $<$ 0.05), the arm range of motion (P $<$ 0.01), the arm and trunk movement area (P $<$ 0.01) and the acceleration of the arm (P $<$ 0.01). In the chronic pain condition, the variability of arm and trunk acceleration (P $<$ 0.01) and EMG activity (P $<$ 0.05) was decreased compared with healthy controls. These results indicate that pain alters the magnitude of motor variability, and that the transition from acute to chronic pain is accompanied by changes in motor patterns. Experimental pain likely resulted in a quest for a motor solution reducing nociceptive influx, while chronic pain was characterised by a diminished motor flexibility.},

It is divided into 14 sections organized by anatomical region: the muscles of the hand, forearm, arm, shoulder girdle, foot, leg, thigh, pelvis, hip joint, perineal region, paraspinal region, abdominal wall, the intercostals and diaphragm regions, along with the muscles innervated by cranial nerves. This information includes the innervations and attachments of each muscle, how to position the patient for examination, the appropriate site for insertion of the electrode, the depth of insertion for the electrode, and the action that the patient should perform to activate the muscle. The descriptions of the techniques used for rarely examined muscles are sufficient for a clinician to have the confidence needed to perform the procedure. Common errors in electrode placement and clinically relevant comments are illustrated and discussed, including cross-sectional illustrations on the appendicular muscles. A particularly useful inclusion is 'Pitfalls' that describes which muscle the electrode will record if the needle is placed too deep, not deep enough, or not at the location described. The text contains a useful appendix, providing dermatomes of the limb and trunk, cutaneous innervations of the head, and excellent illustrations of both the brachial plexus and the lumbo-sacral-coccygeal plexus. The appendix also contains a useful table listing all muscles that are presented in the text with innervations from the peripheral nerve to the mixed spinal nerve root. Well organized, clearly and concisely written, this book remains a learning tool and excellent reference for electromyographers and for healthcare practitioners who are expanding their practice skills to include diagnostic EMG, as well as for graduate students who use EMG as part of their research.},

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: In vivo laboratory studies were conducted to investigate the spine loads imposed on men and women during a series of lifting tasks that varied in the degree of lifting control required by the subject.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and understand differences in spine loading and musculoskeletal control strategies between men and women performing lifts of varying task complexity.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies have examined differences in spine loading as a function of individual factors such as subject gender. Furthermore, no biomechanical studies have attempted to quantify and understand how differences in anthropometry between genders might influence muscle recruitment and subsequent spine loads. Because the modern workplace seldom discriminates between genders in job assignments, it is important to understand how differences in spine loading and potential low back disorder risk might be associated with gender differences.
METHODS: For this study, 140 subjects participated in two separate experiments requiring different degrees of musculoskeletal motion control during sagittal plane lifting. The two experiments consisted of 35 men and 35 women performing lifts in which motion was isolated to the torso and 35 men and 35 women completing whole-body free-dynamic whole body lifts. An electromyography-assisted model was used to evaluate spine loading under these conditions.
RESULTS: Absolute spine compression generally was greater for the men. Under the highly controlled (isolated torso) conditions, most differences were attributed solely to differences in body mass. Under a whole-body free-dynamic condition, significant differences in muscle coactivations resulted in greater relative compression and anterior-posterior shear spine loading for the women.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in spine loadings as a function of gender under the more controlled lifting conditions were primarily a function of different body masses. However, loading pattern differences existed between the genders under whole-body free-dynamic conditions as a result of kinematic compensations and increases in muscle cocontraction, with women generally experiencing greater relative loads. When spine tolerance differences are considered, one would expect that females would be at greater risk of musculoskeletal overload during lifting tasks.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that males and females differ with respect to the perception and experience of pain. Much of this work focuses on biological factors, yet it is also acknowledged that psychosocial issues are important. Within humans, socially and culturally constructed meanings of being and acting as a man or a woman should help us understand sex-related differences in pain. However, such an approach has not been widely adopted, partly because of problems conveying sex and gender concepts. We argue here for an assimilation of gender studies concepts into pain research as a means of developing our understanding of the psychosocial influences on pain in men and women. In order to bridge the gap between gender studies and pain, we draw on theoretical developments in such gender concepts, and illustrate their application to pain. We make use of Doise's [Doise W. Levels of explanation in social psychology [Mapstone E, Trans.]. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press. 1986 [original work published 1982]] meta-theoretical model of levels of explanation in social psychology to show how gender may be conceptualized at an intra-individual, situational, positional and ideological level of analysis. We then selectively review existing gender and pain research using these different levels of explanation. In doing so we also highlight that by considering the gender conceptualizations underpinning such studies we are able to point to directions for future research. We conclude by arguing that this approach opens up a new avenue for pain researchers, which we hope will further our understanding of this interesting phenomena.},

Linear regression analyses were performed for all motions except forward elevation. This motion, which showed a nonlinear pattern of decline with age, was evaluated with 3-way analysis of variance. Shoulder range of motion decreased with age for all measured motions with the exception of internal rotation, which increased with age. Female subjects had a significantly greater range of motion than male subjects for all motions measured. Dominant arms displayed significantly greater external rotation than nondominant, regardless of whether the arm was abducted or adducted at the time of measurement. However, nondominant shoulders demonstrated significantly greater internal rotation and extension than dominant. No significant differences were found between dominant and nondominant sides for forward elevation or abduction.},

Muscle biopsies were obtained from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of 15 men and 15 women (age 20-31 years) with comparable physical activity levels. The muscle CSA was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Maximal activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphofructokinase (PFK), beta-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (HAD), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and citrate synthase (CS), were assayed spectrophotometrically. The proportion, mean area and relative area (proportion x area) of type 1 and type 2 fibres were determined from muscle biopsies prepared for enzyme histochemistry [myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (mATPase)]. The men were significantly taller (+6.6\%; P $<$ 0.001) and heavier (+19.1\%; P $<$ 0.001), had significantly larger muscle CSA (+19.0\%; P $<$ 0.001) and significantly larger areas and relative areas of both type 1 and type 2 fibres (+20.5-31.4\%; P = 0.007 to P $<$ 0.001). The men had significantly higher maximal enzyme activities than women for LDH (+27.6\%; P = 0.007) and PFK (+25.5\%; P = 0.003). There were no significant differences between the men and the women in the activities of HAD (+3.6\%; ns), CS (+21.1\%; P = 0.084) and SDH (+7.6\%; ns). There were significant relationships between height and LDH (r = 0.41; P = 0.023), height and PFK (r = 0.41; P = 0.025), weight and LDH (r = 0.45; P = 0.013), and weight and PFK (r = 0.39; P = 0.032). The relationships were significant between the muscle CSA and the activities of LDH (r = 0.61; P $<$ 0.001) and PFK (r = 0.56; P = 0.001), and between the relative area of type 2 fibres and the activities of LDH (r = 0.49; P = 0.006) and PFK (r = 0.42; P = 0.023). There were no significant relationships between HAD, CS and SDH, and height, weight, muscle CSA and fibre type composition, respectively. These data indicate that the higher maximal activities of LDH and PFK in men are related to the height, weight, muscle CSA and the relative area of type 2 fibres, which are all significantly larger in men than women.},

  abstract = {A study was performed to determine the influence of load magnitude on the self selected technique of lifting. Specifically, it was hypothesized that with heavier weights a tendency would occur to lift more with the back and less with the legs. Flexion-extension moments at the L5/S1 level, hip and knee joints were calculated for subjects when lifting boxes weighing from 50 to 250 N. Lifts were performed using a freestyle technique at normal speed. The moment profiles (moment plotted vs time) were analyzed kinematically and as a function of the weight lifted. The kinematics of the lift changed as the weight increased. The moment at the L5/S1 level increased with increasing weight, however, the corresponding knee moment decreased. Thus, an inverse relationship was found between the moment at the L5/S1 level and the knee joint moment. An increase in weight lifted was also associated with an increase in the angular velocity at the knee while lifting. Apparently with heavier weights there is a tendency to extend the knees earlier during the lift than with lighter weights, confirming our hypothesis. This explains the reduced knee moment. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that quadriceps muscle strength limits the subjects' ability to lift with their knees flexed.},

  abstract = {This study examined gender differences in the effect of experimental muscle pain on changes in the relative activation of regions of the upper trapezius muscle during a sustained contraction. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from multiple locations over the upper trapezius muscle with a 10 x 5 grid of electrodes from nine women and nine men during 90 degrees shoulder abduction sustained for 60s. Measurements were performed before and after the injection of 0.4 ml hypertonic (painful) and isotonic (control) saline into the cranial region of the upper trapezius muscle. The EMG root mean square (RMS) was computed for each location of the grid to form a map of the EMG amplitude distribution. The peak pain intensity following the injection of hypertonic saline was greater for women (numerical rating scale 0-10: women 6.0+/-2.1, men 4.2+/-0.9; P$<$0.01). For both genders, upper trapezius RMS averaged across the grid decreased following the injection of hypertonic saline (P$<$0.0001). Moreover, there was a relatively larger pain-induced decrease in RMS in the cranial region compared to the caudal region of the muscle for both genders. During the non-painful sustained contractions, the EMG RMS progressively increased more in the cranial than the caudal region, for both men and women, due to fatigue. This mechanism was maintained in men but not in women during the painful condition. The results demonstrate that muscle pain alters the normal adaptation of upper trapezius muscle activity to fatigue in women but not in men.},

  abstract = {Subacromial impingement occurs when tissues interposed between the humeral head and the acromion become compressed between the bones. Two fatigue-related mechanisms are suggested to contribute to this impingement: superior humeral head migration and scapular reorientation, specifically downward rotation, anterior tilt and protraction. Although both mechanisms have received attention, controversy exists regarding their relative contributions to reducing subacromial space width. This simulation study presents a three-dimensional orthopedic model for assessing the spatial relationship between the humerus and the scapula. Through incorporating empirically generated fatigue data as inputs, changes in the subacromial space associated with each mechanism acting independently and in combination were quantified. These changes were examined for three scenarios (average, impingement sparing, impingement causing) and at three humeral elevation angles (0$^\circ$, 45$^\circ$ and 90$^\circ$) in a total of 36 unique simulations. Humeral head migration generally decreased the subacromial space and scapular reorientation generally increased the space across scenarios. This strongly implies that superior humeral migration is the dominant fatigue-related mechanism associated with increasing the likelihood of impingement. The results suggest that future research should target efforts to reduce migration in industry, primarily through avoidance or modification of situations known to induce rotator cuff fatigue, such as overhead work.},

Eight women (25.6 +/- 3.6 yr, mean +/- SD) and 9 men (25.4 +/- 3.8 yr) performed six sustained MVCs (22-s duration each, separated by 10 s). Before the fatiguing contractions, the men were stronger than the women (75.9 +/- 9.2 vs. 42.7 +/- 8.0 N.m; P $<$ 0.05) in control MVCs. Voluntary activation measured with cortical stimulation before fatigue was similar for the men and women during the final control MVC (95.7 +/- 3.0 vs. 93.3 +/- 3.6\%; P $>$ 0.05) and at the start of the fatiguing task (P $>$ 0.05). By the end of the six sustained fatiguing MVCs, the men exhibited greater absolute and relative reductions in torque (65 +/- 3\% of initial MVC) than the women (52 +/- 9\%; P $<$ 0.05). The increments in torque (superimposed twitch) generated by motor cortex stimulation during each 22-s maximal effort increased with fatigue (P $<$ 0.05). Superimposed twitches were similar for men and women throughout the fatiguing task (5.5 +/- 4.1 vs. 7.3 +/- 4.7\%; P $>$ 0.05), as well as in the last sustained contraction (7.8 +/- 5.9 vs. 10.5 +/- 5.5\%) and in brief recovery MVCs. Voluntary activation determined using an estimated control twitch was similar for the men and women at the start of the sustained maximal contractions (91.4 +/- 7.4 vs. 90.4 +/- 6.8\%, n = 13) and end of the sixth contraction (77.2 +/- 13.3\% vs. 73.1 +/- 19.6\%, n = 10). The increase in the area of the motor-evoked potential and duration of the silent period did not differ for men and women during the fatiguing task. However, estimated resting twitch amplitude and the peak rates of muscle relaxation showed greater relative reductions at the end of the fatiguing task for the men than the women. These results indicate that the sex difference in fatigue of the elbow flexor muscles is not explained by a difference in supraspinal fatigue in men and women but is largely due to a sex difference of mechanisms located within the elbow flexor muscles.},

A total of 418 biopsies was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle of 270 healthy sedentary and 148 physically active individuals of both sexes. The lowest and highest proportion of type I muscle fiber observed were 15 and 85\%, respectively. Coefficients of variation (CV) reached approximately 30\% for the proportion of types I and IIA fibers and were two times higher for the proportion of type IIB fiber. The smallest and largest mean muscle fiber cross-sectional areas (CSA) were approximately 1,100 microns 2 and 9,500 microns 2, respectively. Mean CSA of the various fiber types exhibited CV of approximately 23\%. CV reached 30\% for the activity of creatine kinase, ranged between 28 and 41\% for the glycolytic enzyme markers, and between 34 and 44\% for the aerobic-oxidative enzyme markers. The mean proportion of type I fiber was lower in male than in female muscles, whereas the mean CSA of all fiber types was smaller in female than in male muscles. Levels of glycolytic enzyme markers were higher in male than in female skeletal muscles. However, activities of aerobic-oxidative enzyme markers were similar in males and females. These results reveal the existence of large interindividual variability and gender differences in the most common characteristics of the human skeletal muscle.},

  abstract = {Upper limb muscle force estimation using Hill-type muscle models depends on musculotendon parameter values, which cannot be readily measured non-invasively. Generic and scaled-generic parameters may be quickly and easily employed, but these approaches do not account for an individual subject's joint torque capacity. The objective of the present study was to develop a subject-specific experimental testing and modeling framework to evaluate shoulder muscle and joint function during activities of daily living, and to assess the reliability of generic and scaled-generic musculotendon parameters in predicting muscle and joint function. Three-dimensional musculoskeletal models of the shoulders of 6 healthy subjects were developed to calculate muscle and glenohumeral joint loading during abduction, flexion, horizontal flexion, nose-touch and reaching using subject-specific, scaled-generic and generic musculotendon parameters. Muscle and glenohumeral joint forces calculated using generic and scaled-generic models were significantly different to those of subject-specific models (p\&lt;0.05), and task dependent; however, scaled-generic model calculations of shoulder glenohumeral joint force demonstrated better agreement with those of subject -specific models during abduction and flexion. Muscles in generic musculoskeletal models operated further from the plateau of their force-length curves than those of scaled-generic and subject-specific models, while muscles in subject-specific models operated over a wider region of their force length curves than those of the generic or scaled-generic models, reflecting diversity of subject shoulder strength. The findings of this study suggest that generic and scaled-generic musculotendon parameters may not provide sufficient accuracy in prediction of shoulder muscle and joint loading when compared to models that employ subject-specific parameter-estimation approaches.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of gender differences on force variability as assessed by means of linear and nonlinear estimators during short duration, ramp and sustained isometric elbow flexions. Ten males and ten females performed elbow flexion receiving visual feedback from the direction of force exertion. Isometric elbow flexions were performed during: maximum voluntary contraction (MVC before and after endurance test), short contraction at 10-90\% MVC with 10\% increment for 5s, ramp contraction from 5\% to 50\% MVC over 30s, and endurance contraction at 20\% MVC. Standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variations (CV), and sample entropy (SaEn) were computed from the force signals recorded in 3D. During short and ramp contraction, SD increased with contraction level while SaEn followed an inverted U-shape function (p$<$.01). During endurance test, SD and CV increased with contraction time (p$<$.01). SD and SaEn were consistently higher in males than females while it was opposite for CV (p$<$.05). Separate control and compensatory mechanisms could be responsible for the observed changes in the amount and structure of task-related and tangential forces variability. Moreover, gender differences most likely point towards gender-dependent force control mechanisms. The lower magnitude and structure of variability observed in females may increase the risk of muscle overload and damage.},

Work-related musculoskeletal disorders describe a wide range of inflammatory and degenerative diseases and disorders. These conditions result in pain and functional impairment and may affect, besides others, the neck, shoulders, elbows, forearms, wrists and hands. They are work-related when the work activities and work conditions significantly contribute to their development or exacerbation but are not necessarily the sole determinant of causation. The classification and the need for standardised diagnostic methods for assessment of neck and upper limb musculoskeletal disorders are reviewed. These disorders are a significant problem within the European Union with respect to ill health, productivity and associated costs. The pathomechanisms of musculoskeletal disorders affecting tendons, ligaments, nerves, muscle, circulation and pain perception are reviewed and conceptual models for the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the neck and upper limbs are presented. The epidemiological evidence on the work-relatedness of these disorders is discussed. A relationship between the performance of work and the occurrence of neck and upper limb musculoskeletal disorders is evident. Intervention strategies in the workplace for the reduction of both exposure and effect should focus upon factors within the work organisation as well as actively involving the individual worker. The current knowledge is sufficient to enable informed decisions to be made on future research needs and prevention strategies at the societal, organisational and individual level.},

  abstract = {In 1985, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) convened an ad hoc committee of experts who reviewed the current literature on lifting, recommend criteria for defining lifting capacity, and in 1991 developed a revised lifting equation. Subsequently, NIOSH developed the documentation for the equation and played a prominent role in recommending methods for interpreting the results of the equation. The 1991 equation reflects new findings and provides methods for evaluating asymmetrical lifting tasks, lifts of objects with less than optimal hand-container couplings, and also provides guidelines for a larger range of work durations and lifting frequencies than the 1981 equation. This paper provides the basis for selecting the three criteria (biomechanical, physiological, and psychophysical) that were used to define the 1991 equation, and describes the derivation of the individual components (Putz-Anderson and Waters 1991). The paper also describes the lifting index (LI), an index of relative physical stress, that can be used to identify hazardous lifting tasks. Although the 1991 equation has not been fully validated, the recommended weight limits derived from the revised equation are consistent with or lower than those generally reported in the literature. NIOSH believes that the revised 1991 lifting equation is more likely than the 1981 equation to protect most workers.},

  abstract = {Although numerous studies have analyzed the relationship between manual material handling (MMH) and the forces acting on the lumbar spine, the difference in the MMH between experts and novices through the analysis of measured data has not been well studied. The purpose of this paper was to analyze the difference in the MMH positions between ten skilled experts working at a freight transport company (Group 1) and five unskilled novices without any experience (Group 2) during asymmetric lifting. All the human subjects performed asymmetric lifting experiments with closed eyes; the experiments involved moving loads (6 and 18 kg) to the left side. Time series data of the vertical ground reaction force were measured, using a Wii Balance Board, and then, the center-of-pressure (CoP) trajectories were calculated. The balance board was used for the measurement, because it was reliable, inexpensive, and portable and provided good repeatability even on rough surfaces, and all the information pertaining to the load and worker under various conditions was captured without any omissions. Under the 18 kg load condition, the CoP positions for Group 2 were located on the same side during left asymmetric lifting; however, those for Group 1 were located on the opposite side during left asymmetric lifting ( \$P $<$0.001\$ ). Furthermore, under the 6 kg load condition, the load weight influenced asymmetric lifting for most subjects of Group 2 such that the CoP positions were located on the opposite side ( \$P $<$0.001\$ ). Based on the simulation and electromyography measurement results, we inferred that the difference in the CoP positions between the two different groups could be attributed to the difference in the hip positions. Most skilled experts position their hips in such a way that their CoP trajectories move toward the opposite side during- left asymmetric lifting. Although the skillful characteristics of experts may be responsible for the lightening of the burden on the waist during asymmetric lifting, there are still two points that this paper does not clarify: the relationship between the experts' adjustment of the hip position and the load of the weight, and the influence of an imbalance of the CoP position on the forces acting on the lumbar spine.},

  abstract = {Work-related musculoskeletal disorders, or WMSDs, have become a major problem in many industrialized countries. It was previously thought that the number of repetitive jobs would decline in the future, which would have led to a decline in the number of WMSDs: however this has not been the case. Some government agencies expect WMSDs to be one of the major work-related disorders of the late 20th early 21st centuries.; WMSDs have the face of Janus; on one hand they are diseases like any other, having their natural history, diagnostic criteria and therapy. On the other hand, having been designated work-related, they have become the subject of special legislation and compensation. This has an influence on how they are understood and how companies and labour react to them.; This book contains evaluated scientific information that should help prevent WMSDs. It is derived from original research and field experience via a Canadian Government sponsored project on work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The team was headed by Ilkka Kuorinka, past President of the IEA, and consisted of a group of international experts in the field. The expert group's goal was two fold: the first objective was to examine the work-relatedness of WMSDs in the light of existing literature, and the second was to explore and systhesize information, avenues and approaches that could help in the prevention of WMSDs. The content of this book is the result of a collective effort by everyone, experts and scientific editors alike; each chapter has had one or two main authors. Its central themes are identification, evaluation, action, implementation, and change.},

This holds true for the compound electromyographic signal and for single motor units. Low threshold motor units have been identified that are recruited continuously, the so called Cinderella fibers. The physiologic consequences of prolonged muscle fiber activity are reviewed, revealing mechanisms for the development of necrotic changes in the muscle, which support the likelihood of work relatedness for musculoskeletal disorders.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neck/Shoulder pain is linked to movement repetition, awkward postures, prolonged maintenance of static postures, and muscular fatigue. Studies have examined the influence of pain and fatigue on movement characteristics, but few reported multi-dimensional adaptations to movement repetition. We compared the adaptations measured in three-dimensions during a repetitive reaching task in persons with chronic neck/shoulder pain and healthy subjects.
METHODS: A shoulder-injured group (intensity $>$3/10, duration $>$3 consecutive months) and an age-sex-matched control group (n=16 in each) performed a repetitive reaching task to voluntary termination. Kinematics, kinetics, heart rate and muscle activity were recorded throughout. Power output on a 10-s pushing/pulling task was assessed pre- and post-reaching. Group comparisons were made in absolute time and at task end.
FINDINGS: Control subjects performed the task 55\% longer than the pain group; yet, both groups demonstrated task-related increased heart rate (6 beats per minute) and decreased power output (6 W). Throughout the task, the pain group demonstrated: higher supraspinatus activity, and less elbow flexion and endpoint movement. The control group increased movement amplitude of the endpoint, elbow, and shoulder, while the pain group moved the shoulder less and increased center of mass excursion to maintain the task.
INTERPRETATION: Both groups adapted to the task in unique ways. The control group continually increased elbow and endpoint range of motion, bringing the arm closer to the targets, possibly to prolong task performance. The pain group used a fixed, en block arm strategy, likely to reduce the load on the injured structures; however, this may place other structures at risk for pain and injury.},

Many of the interactions between these properties pose trade-offs such that an individual's anthropometrics and muscle morphology may allow an athlete to excel in one sport but not in others. Advanced modeling and simulation techniques are powerful tools to gain insight into performance limits, optimal equipment designs, and mechanisms that may lead to injury. Recent technological innovations have produced faster running tracks, bicycles, speed skates, and swimming pools. This review discusses the influence of intrinsic muscle properties in sports and how advanced technology can be used to extend the limits of human performance.},

  abstract = {Neck/shoulder pain is linked to movement repetition, awkward postures, and muscular fatigue. Studies have examined the influence of pain and fatigue on movement characteristics, but few report spatial and temporal characteristics within- and between-dynamic movements. The combined influences of fatigue and pain on these parameters are examined here. A shoulder-injured group (PAIN) (intensity $>$3/10, duration $>$3 consecutive months) and an age-sex-matched control group (CTRL) (n~=~16 in each) performed a repetitive reaching task to voluntary termination. Kinematics, heart rate, and muscle activity were recorded. Group comparisons were made at the beginning and end of task. Both pain and fatigue changed movement parameters with CTRL subjects adapting to fatigue with increased arm movement, while the PAIN group increased center of mass (CoM) and minimized shoulder movement. Fatigue was associated with decreased arm relative variability, while pain caused increased arm and decreased CoM relative variability. Time to peak velocity tended to indicate increased joint coupling in the CTRL group only. Together, this suggests that despite initial differences in movement strategies, both groups tend to move toward more fixed movement strategies at the end of the task. Those of CTRL are more fixed temporally and spatially (in the arm), whereas the PAIN group adaptations are primarily spatial in nature and appear to focus on controlling CoM.},

  abstract = {It is not clear how males and females cope with pain over time and how sensory and emotional qualities fluctuate from moment to moment, although studies of pain at discrete time points suggest that women are more pain sensitive than men. Therefore, we developed a new broader-based pain model that incorporates a temporally continuous assessment of multiple pain dimensions across sensory and affective dimensions, and normalized peak pain intensity to unmask sex differences that may otherwise be confounded by inter-individual variability in pain sensitivity. We obtained continuous ratings of pain, burning, sharp, stinging, cutting, and annoyance evoked by repeated prolonged noxious heat stimuli in 32 subjects. Strikingly, females reported more pain than males at the outset of the first exposure to pain, but then experienced less pain and annoyance than males as a painful stimulus was sustained and with repeated stimulation. Patterns of pain and annoyance attenuation in women resembled the attenuation of sharp, stinging and cutting sensations, whereas patterns of pain and annoyance in men resembled burning sensations. Taken together, these data demonstrate a prominent sex difference in the time course of pain. Notably only females demonstrate adaptation and habituation that allow them to experience less pain over time. These findings suggest a sexual dichotomy in mechanisms underlying pain intensity and annoyance that could involve specific quality-linked mechanisms. Importantly, temporal processing of pain differs between males and females when adjusted for sex differences in pain sensitivity. Our findings provide insight into sex differences in tonic and possibly chronic pains.},

Inaccuracies will lead to bias toward the null value in certain cases. Job title has often been used as a proxy for exposure status. This study was undertaken to examine content (ie, tasks and activities) associated with job title among men and women in a large Qu{\'e}bec municipality. Occupational accident reports were studied for 1589 accidents, and 113 men and women workers were interviewed about job content. Women and men did not seem to have the same accident rates. From interview data, it appeared that women and men with the same job title did not perform the same tasks. Thus, they might have different exposures. The data reported here support caution in using job title to estimate exposure for both genders if the job-exposure matrix has not previously been validated separately by gender. In addition, it may be unwise to adjust relationships between job title and cancer incidence for gender, thus treating gender as a confounder when it may be a proxy for specific exposures.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to (a) establish biomechanical and physiological normative data for healthy young women performing three tasks on the Baltimore Therapeutic Equipment work simulator (BTE): wheel-turn, push-pull, and overhead-reach; and (b) compare these data with previously reported values for healthy men of a similar age group.
METHOD: Twenty women completed five test sessions: (a) task familiarization on the BTE to determine the work intensity that was perceived as hard on the Borg scale, (b) incremental test on an arm crank ergometer to measure peak oxygen uptake (VO2) and peak heart rate (HR), and (c) one of the three tasks in random order for 4 min during the next three sessions. Physiological responses were monitored with a metabolic cart interfaced with an electrocardiogram.
RESULTS: Torque, work, and power during the three tasks were significantly higher (p $<$ .05) in men than in women. The absolute VO2 (L.min-1) during these tasks was higher in men, but when the VO2 was calculated relative to body weight (ml.kg-1.min-1), no significant (p $>$ .05) gender differences were observed. Computation of energy expenditure relative to body weight and power output (cal.kg-1.W-1) indicated that women expended significantly (p $<$ .05) more energy than men. No significant (p $>$ .05) gender differences were observed for VO2 and HR when the values were expressed as a percentage of their respective peaks.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicated that (a) the functional work capacity is significantly lower in women than in men, (b) women are less efficient than men when the energy expenditure is expressed per unit of body weight and power output, and (c) the relative physiological stress in men and women is similar under these conditions.},

Subjects performed isotonic and isometric trunk extension exercise to muscular failure at 50\% of maximum voluntary contraction force. Women exhibited a longer endurance time than men during the isometric task (146.0 +/- 10.9 vs. 105.4 +/- 7.9 s), but there was no difference in endurance performance during the isotonic exercise (24.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 24.0 +/- 2.8 repetitions). Absolute load was significantly related to isometric endurance time in the pooled sample (R(2) = 0.34) but not when men and women were analyzed separately (R(2) = 0.05 and 0.04, respectively). EMG data showed no differences in neuromuscular activation patterns; however, gender differences in MF shifts were observed. Women demonstrated a similar fatigability in the biceps femoris and lumbar extensors, whereas in men, the fatigability was more pronounced in the lumbar musculature than in the biceps femoris. Additionally, the MF of the lumbar extensors demonstrated a greater association with endurance time in men than in women (R(2) = 0.45 vs. 0.19). These findings suggest that gender differences in muscle fatigue are influenced by muscle contraction type and frequency shifts in the EMG signal but not by alterations in the synergistic activation patterns.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of mechanical exposure and work related psychosocial factors on shoulder and neck pain.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: 4919 randomly chosen, vocationally active men and women ages 45-65 residing in a Swedish city. Neck and shoulder pain were determined by the standardised Nordic questionnaire. Mechanical exposure was assessed by an index based on 11 items designed and evaluated for shoulder and neck disorders. Work related psychosocial factors were measured by the Karasek and Theorell demand-control instrument.
MAIN RESULTS: High mechanical exposure was associated with heightened risk for shoulder and neck pain among men and women during follow up. Age adjusted odds ratios (OR) were 2.17 (95\% confidence intervals (CI): 1.65, 2.85) and 1.59 (95\% CI: 1.22, 2.06), respectively. In women, job strain (high psychological job demands and low job decision latitude) correlated with heightened risk (OR = 1.73, 95\% CI: 1.29, 2.31). These risk estimates remained statistically significant when controlled for high mechanical exposure regarding job strain (and vice versa), and for sociodemographic factors. Testing for effect modification between high mechanical exposure and job strain showed them acting synergistically only in women.
CONCLUSION: Job related mechanical exposure in both sexes, and psychosocial factors in women, seem independently of each other to play a part for development of shoulder and neck pain in vocationally active people. The effect of psychosocial factors was more prominent in women, which could be the result of biological factors as well as gender issues. These results suggest that interventions aiming at reducing the occurrence of shoulder and neck pain should include both mechanical and psychosocial factors.},

During the first 6 months of employment, cycle time variability decreased, while posture and movement variability increased (p $<$ 0.05). In presence of pain, the variability of the initial arm position decreased while it increased for the trunk (p $<$ 0.05). Experienced butchers showed a larger variability than novices for work cycle and several kinematic variables, but a smaller EMG ratio variability (p $<$ 0.05).

Young adults were stronger than old adults (66.8 +/- 17.9 vs. 47.7 +/- 18.1 N x m, P $<$ 0.05), and men were stronger than women (69.8 +/- 17.9 vs. 47.1 +/- 15.3 N x m, P $<$ 0.05), with no interaction between age and sex (P $>$ 0.05). Time to task failure was longer for old than for young adults (22.8 +/- 9.1 vs. 14.4 +/- 7.6 min, P $<$ 0.05) and for young women than for young men (18.3 +/- 8.0 vs. 10.8 +/- 5.2, P $<$ 0.05), but there was no difference between old women and men (21.3 +/- 10.7 and 24.1 +/- 8.0 min, respectively, P $>$ 0.05) or between young women and old adults (P $>$ 0.05). Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, average electromyographic (EMG) activity, and torque fluctuations of elbow flexor muscles increased during the fatiguing contraction (P $<$ 0.05) for all subjects. Rates of increase in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and torque fluctuations were greater for young men and old adults, with no differences between old men and women (P $>$ 0.05). Similarly, the rate of increase in EMG activity was greater for young men than for the other three groups. EMG bursts were less frequent for old adults (P $<$ 0.05) at the end of the fatiguing contraction, and this was accompanied by reduced fluctuations in torque. Consequently, time to task failure was related to target torque for young, but not old, adults, and differences in task duration were accompanied by parallel changes in the pressor response.},

  abstract = {During multijoint limb movements such as reaching, rotational forces arise at one joint due to the motions of limb segments about other joints. We report the results of three experiments in which we assessed the extent to which control signals to muscles are adjusted to counteract these "interaction torques." Human subjects performed single- and multijoint pointing movements involving shoulder and elbow motion, and movement parameters related to the magnitude and direction of interaction torques were manipulated systematically. We examined electromyographic (EMG) activity of shoulder and elbow muscles and, specifically, the relationship between EMG activity and joint interaction torque. A first set of experiments examined single-joint movements. During both single-joint elbow (experiment 1) and shoulder (experiment 2) movements, phasic EMG activity was observed in muscles spanning the stationary joint (shoulder muscles in experiment 1 and elbow muscles in experiment 2). This muscle activity preceded movement and varied in amplitude with the magnitude of upcoming interaction torque (the load resulting from motion of the nonstationary limb segment). In a third experiment, subjects performed multijoint movements involving simultaneous motion at the shoulder and elbow. Movement amplitude and velocity at one joint were held constant, while the direction of movement about the other joint was varied. When the direction of elbow motion was varied (flexion vs. extension) and shoulder kinematics were held constant, EMG activity in shoulder muscles varied depending on the direction of elbow motion (and hence the sign of the interaction torque arising at the shoulder). Similarly, EMG activity in elbow muscles varied depending on the direction of shoulder motion for movements in which elbow kinematics were held constant. The results from all three experiments support the idea that central control signals to muscles are adjusted, in a predictive manner, to compensate for interaction torques-loads arising at one joint that depend on motion about other joints.},

The aim was to assess these disorders based on quantitative EMG indicators and functional tests. 252 female computer users (45-68 years) were recruited from four European countries in two contrast groups: (1) 88 neck/shoulder (NS) cases reporting trouble in the neck and/or shoulder region for more than 30 days during the last year, and (2) 164 NS-controls reporting such trouble for no more than 7 days. Questionnaires, functional/clinical tests, and physiological recordings were performed in workplace related field studies. The results showed no differences in anthropometrics but NS-cases reported more strained head positions and more eye problems than controls. The psychosocial working factors were similar, although, NS-controls had slightly better scores on working conditions, general health, and vitality compared to cases. The NS-cases had lower maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) during shoulder elevation (mean (SD) 310 (122) N) compared to the controls (364 (122) N). During 30\% MVC electromyography (EMGrms) in the trapezius muscle was lower in NS-cases (194 (105) muV) than in controls (256 (169) muV), while no differences were found regarding endurance time. Estimated conduction velocity was not different between NS-cases and -controls. Four functional computer tests were performed equally well by NS-cases and -controls, and the corresponding EMG variables also did not differ. A major finding in this large-scale epidemiological study is the significantly lower MVC in NS-cases compared with NS-controls together with lower EMGrms value at 30\% MVC, while computer tasks were performed at similar relative muscle activation. The study was unable to reveal quantitative EMG indicators and functional tests that could objectively assess disorders in NS-cases.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify gender-related differences in glenohumeral (GH) joint laxity, stiffness, and generalized joint hypermobility in healthy men and women.
METHODS: Fifty-one healthy men and women were tested for generalized joint hypermobility, and anterior-posterior (AP) joint laxity and stiffness using a single-group factorial design.
RESULTS: Women exhibited significantly more anterior joint laxity (men 8.3 +/- 2.2 mm vs women 11.4 +/- 2.8 mm, P $<$ 0.001) and less anterior joint stiffness (men 20.5 +/- 5.0 N x mm(-1) vs women 16.3 +/- 4.2 N x mm(-1), P $<$ 0.01) than men. Men had significantly more posterior joint laxity than anterior (Ant 8.3 +/- 2.2 mm vs Post 9.6 +/- 2.9 mm; P $<$ 0.001), and women also had significantly less anterior joint stiffness than posterior [Ant 16.3 +/- 4.2 N x mm(-1) vs Post 22.1 +/- 6.9 N x mm(-1); P $<$ 0.01], Women also demonstrated significantly more generalized joint hypermobility than men (men 1.0 +/- 1.7 vs women 2.9 +/- 2.1; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may indicate a possible increased risk for instability in women, especially those participating in sports that require repetitive overhead-throwing motion. Future investigations should seek to determine the contribution of increased GH joint laxity and decreased joint stiffness to various injury states and examine these variables in other populations such as overhead-throwing athletes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Due to the low osseous lead of the shoulder joint a large portion of the shoulder muscles, in addition to executing movements, deals with stabilising tasks. This requires a permanent readjustment of the intermuscular co-ordination of all involved muscles. The aim of the study was to verify the existence of gender dependent differences in intramuscular co-ordination patterns of shoulder muscles.
METHOD: Fifteen healthy men and nine healthy women, who executed 24 isometric exercises in sagittal, frontal and horizontal planes with a loading of 50\% of their individual isometric maximum force, were investigated. In every plane, four angular positions were chosen and both opposite force directions were measured, respectively. SEMG was taken from 13 muscles of the shoulder and the upper arm. Due to inter-individual differences SEMG amplitudes were normalised.
RESULTS: Gender specific differences of functional intermuscular co-ordination patterns could be proven systematically. Women showed less activation of muscles acting in the main force direction. In addition, those muscles less necessary for the actual force production were more activated in women than in men.
CONCLUSIONS: Functionally comparable shoulder function showed a gender dependency in terms of functional intermuscular co-ordination.},

Ten novice workers performed three tasks evaluated for the effects of load tilting (tilts vs no tilts) and shoulders positioning (non-parallel vs parallel to the ground). Specific comparisons were made using three referential systems.BACKGROUND. Box handgrips/tilting and body posture are factors differentiating expert and novice workers which present a potential for reducing asymmetries. The literature also suggests that different conclusions may be reached about asymmetry with different systems of axes.METHODS. Net 3D moments at L5/S1 were obtained from two force platforms, four video cameras and inverse dynamic analyses using three reference systems of axes (trunk, pelvis, and joint).RESULTS. Tilting the load presented clear advantages of reducing the duration and trajectory of efforts, better positioning the load and reducing knee flexion, peak trunk extensors and mechanical work on the load. The maintenance of the shoulders parallel reduced asymmetries of posture and efforts but the results were affected by the type of reference system of axes chosen.CONCLUSIONS. Box tilting and shoulders positioning should be considered in the reduction of risk factors. More research is needed to define referential systems and characterize asymmetry. RelevanceBox tilting and shoulders positioning appear to be two fundamental elements to take into account in the formation programs based on prevention of risk factors. The importance of asymmetry among the risk factors emphasizes the need for better characterization of this risk.},

  abstract = {The rotator cuff performs multiple functions during shoulder exercises, including glenohumeral abduction, external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR). The rotator cuff also stabilizes the glenohumeral joint and controls humeral head translations. The infraspinatus and subscapularis have significant roles in scapular plane abduction (scaption), generating forces that are two to three times greater than supraspinatus force. However, the supraspinatus still remains a more effective shoulder abductor because of its more effective moment arm. Both the deltoids and rotator cuff provide significant abduction torque, with an estimated contribution up to 35-65\% by the middle deltoid, 30\% by the subscapularis, 25\% by the supraspinatus, 10\% by the infraspinatus and 2\% by the anterior deltoid. During abduction, middle deltoid force has been estimated to be 434 N, followed by 323 N from the anterior deltoid, 283 N from the subscapularis, 205 N from the infraspinatus, and 117 N from the supraspinatus. These forces are generated not only to abduct the shoulder but also to stabilize the joint and neutralize the antagonistic effects of undesirable actions. Relatively high force from the rotator cuff not only helps abduct the shoulder but also neutralizes the superior directed force generated by the deltoids at lower abduction angles. Even though anterior deltoid force is relatively high, its ability to abduct the shoulder is low due to a very small moment arm, especially at low abduction angles. The deltoids are more effective abductors at higher abduction angles while the rotator cuff muscles are more effective abductors at lower abduction angles. During maximum humeral elevation the scapula normally upwardly rotates 45-55 degrees, posterior tilts 20-40 degrees and externally rotates 15-35 degrees. The scapular muscles are important during humeral elevation because they cause these motions, especially the serratus anterior, which contributes to scapular upward rotation, posterior tilt and ER. The serratus anterior also helps stabilize the medial border and inferior angle of the scapular, preventing scapular IR (winging) and anterior tilt. If normal scapular movements are disrupted by abnormal scapular muscle firing patterns, weakness, fatigue, or injury, the shoulder complex functions less efficiency and injury risk increases. Scapula position and humeral rotation can affect injury risk during humeral elevation. Compared with scapular protraction, scapular retraction has been shown to both increase subacromial space width and enhance supraspinatus force production during humeral elevation. Moreover, scapular IR and scapular anterior tilt, both of which decrease subacromial space width and increase impingement risk, are greater when performing scaption with IR ('empty can') compared with scaption with ER ('full can'). There are several exercises in the literature that exhibit high to very high activity from the rotator cuff, deltoids and scapular muscles, such as prone horizontal abduction at 100 degrees abduction with ER, flexion and abduction with ER, 'full can' and 'empty can', D1 and D2 diagonal pattern flexion and extension, ER and IR at 0 degrees and 90 degrees abduction, standing extension from 90-0 degrees , a variety of weight-bearing upper extremity exercises, such as the push-up, standing scapular dynamic hug, forward scapular punch, and rowing type exercises. Supraspinatus activity is similar between 'empty can' and 'full can' exercises, although the 'full can' results in less risk of subacromial impingement. Infraspinatus and subscapularis activity have generally been reported to be higher in the 'full can' compared with the 'empty can', while posterior deltoid activity has been reported to be higher in the 'empty can' than the 'full can'.},

Muscle biopsy samples from the vastus lateralis muscle of 38 females and 37 males were analyzed to determine the fiber type composition (I, IIa, and IIb), the fiber size, and maximal activities of enzyme markers of energy metabolic pathways. Significant correlations were found (p less than 0.05) between percent fiber type I area and hexokinase (r = -0.39), phosphofructokinase (r = -0.39), lactate dehydrogenase (r = -0.41), and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (r = 0.33) activities, whereas such correlations with total phosphorylase (r = -0.02), malate dehydrogenase (r = 0.12), and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (r = 0.12) activities were not significant. The results of the present study also suggest the presence of a significant but low covariation of less than 30\% between the fiber type distribution and muscle enzyme activities. They confirm the presence of an important metabolic heterogeneity independent of the muscle fiber type distribution in sedentary male and female subjects. Moreover, these results indicate that sedentary males exhibit a lower mean value of percent fiber type I and higher glycolytic enzyme activities than sedentary females.},

  volume = {74},
  issn = {0340-0131},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study analysed the association between gender and upper extremity musculoskeletal complaints, among the general working population and in various occupational groups. The hypothesis was tested whether the higher risk for women in the general working population for these complaints could partly be explained by differences in the distribution of men and women in occupations with different risks for the onset of upper extremity musculoskeletal complaints.
METHODS: The data for this study came from cross-sectional questionnaire data from 16,874 employees categorised in 21 different occupational classes. Associations between gender and complaints of the upper extremities were analysed for the total study sample and for each occupational class separately. An adjustment was made for the variable 'occupational class' in the final model in order to study the impact of occupational gender segregation on gender differences in upper extremity complaints in the working population.
RESULTS: In the total study sample, significantly higher risks of complaints of the neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist among the women were observed. Within many occupational classes, women reported significantly higher risks than did men, in particular for complaints of the neck and shoulder. Adjustment for occupational class showed increased risks for female workers for complaints of the neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist, hence, rejecting our hypothesis on occupational gender segregation as an explanation for the higher risks for upper extremity complaints among women in the general working population.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the presence of gender differences in upper extremity musculoskeletal complaints among the working population and in many occupational classes, with female workers having the higher risk. The results, however, do not lend support to a differential occupational exposure theory as an explanation for the higher risks for these complaints among women in the general working population. Careful consideration of gender influence in ergonomic epidemiological studies is recommended.},

  abstract = {AIM: To test the hypothesis that work related mechanical and psychosocial factors predict new onset shoulder pain in newly employed workers.
METHODS: Two year prospective study of newly employed workers from 12 diverse occupational settings. At baseline, 1081 subjects provided information on work related mechanical and psychosocial risk factors, and current pain status.
RESULTS: In all, 803 (74\%) subjects were free from shoulder pain at baseline. Of those, 638 (79\%) responded at 12 months and 476 (88\%) at 24 months. New onset shoulder pain was reported by 93 (15\%) and 73 (15\%) subjects respectively. An increased risk of symptom onset was found in subjects reporting mechanical exposures involving heavy weights including lifting with one or two hands, carrying on one shoulder, lifting at or above shoulder level, and pushing or pulling. Working with hands above shoulder level was also predictive of new onset shoulder pain. Of the psychosocial factors examined, the strongest predictor was monotonous work. Those individuals with any other previous pain also had an increased risk of new onset shoulder pain at follow up. In multivariate analysis, lifting heavy weights with one or two hands, pushing or pulling heavy weights, working with hands above shoulder level, and monotonous work were independently associated with new onset shoulder pain.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesised relation between mechanical risk factors and shoulder pain. In general, work related psychosocial factors were modestly associated with new onset shoulder pain. However, monotonous work was a strong risk factor for new onset shoulder pain.},

The weight lifted as well as the neck posture significantly affected the activities of the neck muscles. Increase in the weight increased the activation of the neck muscles. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was most active at the extended neck posture, while the upper trapezius muscle was most active at the flexed neck posture. The results of this study indicate that the neck muscles play an active role during lifting and holding tasks at shoulder height. Thus, such tasks could be probable risk factors associated with neck disorders prevalent among construction workers.},

The purpose of this study was to quantify the surface EMG activity of the serratus anterior muscle and the upper, middle, and lower parts of the trapezius during 9 manual muscle tests performed with maximum effort in 30 subjects. It was found that no one muscle test produced a MVIC for all individuals. Therefore, to perform normalization within each subject, it is suggested that the 2 or 3 tests identified in this study that produce high levels of EMG activity for each muscle be performed. The scapular protraction muscle test that is often used to normalize data for the serratus anterior muscle produced relatively low levels of EMG activity and was not found to be an optimal test. Muscle tests in which an attempt was made to de-rotate the scapula from an upwardly rotated position produced much higher levels of EMG activity in the serratus anterior muscle.},

The aim of the present exposure session was to compare different physiological stress responses (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine, salivary cortisol) as well as trapezius muscle activity, measured by surface electromyography, during mental and physical stress in 11 women and ten men. The results show significantly increased activity in all measures but cortisol and significant associations between sympathetic arousal and EMG activity. The association between sympathetic arousal and muscle activity is of importance for understanding the high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in mentally stressful but physically light work tasks. Men had higher blood pressure and a more pronounced increase in epinephrine output than women, whereas women had higher heart rate. It was concluded that sympathetic activity is more sensitive to moderately intense stress exposure than pituitary adrenocortical (cortisol) activity and that men respond to performance stress with more epinephrine output than women. Although the correlations between the different indicators of sympathetic arousal were high, together they could still only explain 30-70\% of the inter-individual variance. Thus, several parameters are needed in order to obtain a reliable measure of sympathetic activity.},

  abstract = {Stretching is commonly used prior to exercise, as it is thought to reduce the risk of injury, and it is also used in the preconditioning of tendon grafts. As tendon properties have been shown to be different between genders, it is proposed that stretching will differentially affect the structure. Here we examine the effect of acute stretch on the mechanical properties of both male and female medial gastrocnemius tendon. Female [20 years +/- 1 (SEM), n = 17] and male (22 years +/- 1, n = 18) subjects underwent a 5-min passive dorsiflexion stretch. Prior to and post stretch medial gastrocnemius tendon stiffness (K), length (l) and cross-sectional area (csa) were measured using ultrasonography and dynamometry. Stiffness and Young's modulus (epsilon) were significantly reduced with stretch for both genders (p $<$ 0.05). Females showed significantly (p $<$ 0.05) greater pre- to poststretch decreases in K (22.4 vs. 8.8\%) and epsilon (20.5 vs. 8.4\%) in comparison to males. The present results show that stretching acutely reduces stiffness of the medial gastrocnemius tendon in females and males, with females showing significantly greater change. The observed disparity between genders may be due in part to variations in tendon moment arm and intrinsic differences in tendon composition. These differential changes in tendon mechanical properties have functional, motor control, and injury risk implications, as well as possible implications for preconditioning of tendon grafts.},

Kinematics of upper extremity and the box and electromyography of trunk and upper extremity muscles were collected. Temporal muscle recruitment pattern varied between muscles based on their function. Heavier lifting weight evenly increased the muscle recruitment throughout the lifting period without changing their temporal pattern. In contrary, lifting pace affected the temporal recruitment pattern in most of muscles. The faster lifting pace increased the muscle recruitment at the beginning phase but decreased at the terminal phase of lifting.

  shorttitle = {Occupational Risk Factors for Shoulder Pain},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the available evidence on occupational risk factors of shoulder pain.
METHODS: Relevant reports were identified by a systematic search of Medline, Embase, Psychlit, Cinahl, and Current Contents. The quality of the methods of all selected publications was assessed by two independent reviewers using a standardised checklist. Details were extracted on the study population, exposures (physical load and psychosocial work environment), and results for the association between exposure variables and shoulder pain.
RESULTS: 29 Studies were included in the review; three case-control studies and 26 cross sectional designs. The median method score was 60\% of the maximum attainable score. Potential risk factors related to physical load and included heavy work load, awkward postures, repetitive movements, vibration, and duration of employment. Consistent findings were found for repetitive movements, vibration, and duration of employment (odds ratio (OR) 1.4-46 in studies with method scores $>$/= 60\%). Nearly all studies that assessed psychosocial risk factors reported at least one positive association with shoulder pain, but the results were not consistent across studies for either high psychological demands, poor control at work, poor social support, or job dissatisfaction. Studies with a method score $>$/=60\% reported ORs between 1.3 and 4.0. Substantial heterogeneity across studies for methods used for exposure assessment and data analysis impeded statistical pooling of results.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems likely that shoulder pain is the result of many factors, including physical load and the psychosocial work environment. The available evidence was not consistent across studies, however, and the associations were generally not strong. Future longitudinal research should evaluate the relative importance of each individual risk factor and the role of potential confounding variables-such as exposure during leisure time-to set priorities for the prevention of shoulder pain in occupational settings.},

  volume = {49},
  issn = {0018-7208},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if lifting random unknown weights is more detrimental than lifting sequences of unknown weights and to investigate whether load knowledge impacts the effect of lifting random box weights.
BACKGROUND: Much research has investigated lifting under known load conditions, but few studies have investigated unknown loads, especially when presented in random order. There has been some documentation of alteration in trunk mechanics when there is an overestimation of the unknown load.
METHOD: Ten men and 10 women performed three lifting tasks: random unknown, random known, and same weight. A lumbar motion monitor was used to collect kinematic data, and Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and a task risk rating were also assessed.
RESULTS: Both presentation order and load knowledge impacted trunk kinematics during repeated lifting tasks. However, these differences were relatively low in magnitude. Furthermore, kinematic response and perceived risk and exertion for these conditions varied between genders.
CONCLUSION: Lifting random unknown loads appears to alter kinematic responses, particularly for men. Women attempt to modify the effect of random unknown loads by changing the lifting style through alterations in upper limb motions (e.g., drag box toward them prior to lifting). However, a need remains for a more comprehensive biomechanical investigation (e.g., spine loading) into the effects of random unknown loads because many of the effect sizes were small.
APPLICATION: Small kinematic adaptations resulting from tasks involving unknown and random loads may be mediated by the use of visual cues, order of presentation, or a change in lifting style.},

  title = {Gender Influences on Spine Loads during Complex Lifting},
  volume = {3},
  issn = {1529-9430},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Previous research has documented differences in spine loading between genders when the imposed load is normalized relative to the size of the person. However, under realistic work conditions the magnitude of the load handled is seldom adjusted relative to worker anthropometry. Thus, there is a void in our knowledge in that we do not understand how material handling influences spine loading and potential risk of injury as a function of gender under realistic lifting situations.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the differences in spine loading between men and women when exposed to similar workplace demands.
STUDY DESIGN: A laboratory study was conducted to investigate the biomechanical responses during realistic free-dynamic lifting tasks when subjects lifted from origins and destinations that were either fixed or set relative to the subject's anthropometry.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty men and 20 women asymptomatic for low back pain were recruited to participate in the study.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The three-dimensional spine loads were predicted from a well-established electromyography-assisted model.
METHODS: Both genders completed a series of symmetric and asymmetric (60-degree clockwise) lifts that originated from two shelf heights ("relative" to knee height and "set" at 35 cm from floor) and terminated at one of two destination heights ("relative" to waist and "set" 102 cm from the floor). Three levels of box weight were investigated (6.8, 13.6 and 22.7 kg).
RESULTS: Men had significantly greater compression forces than women (about 640 N). Loading differences between genders were further magnified by several of the workplace factors. The differences between men and women were even greater when lifting either of the heavier loads from the lower fixed shelf (more than 50\% greater).
CONCLUSIONS: It is apparent that men produce the greater loads on their spines during lifting. However, engineering controls, such as adjustable workplace layout or less weight lifted, may reduce or eliminate gender-specific differences in spine loads. Furthermore, the differences in spine loads appear to be a result of kinematic trade-offs and muscle coactivity differences in combination with unequal body masses between genders. However, when the loads were put into context of the expected tolerances of the spine, women were found to be at increased risk of injury, especially when lifting heavy loads or under asymmetric lifting conditions. Collectively, the results indicate the need to account for differences between the genders when designing the workplace.},

  abstract = {The action of the subscapularis muscle is an important component in maintaining shoulder stability. Because of its relative inaccessibility, there have been few electromyographic (EMG) studies of its normal patterns of activity. The subscapularis is innervated by two or more distinct nerves, and therefore the upper and lower parts of the muscle may have different functional roles depending on the position of the humerus. The purpose of this study was to develop safe, reproducible insertion paths to the upper and lower parts of the subscapularis. Six subjects with no previous history of shoulder injury were evaluated. The paths of insertion were designed based on previous anatomical studies as well as dissections. Two pairs of intramuscular wire electrodes were inserted: one directed toward the upper subscapularis and one toward the lower subscapularis. Electrode locations were confirmed using posteroanterior and lateral radiographs and through electrical stimulation. EMG data were recorded during isometric internal rotation exercises with the humerus in 0 or 90 degrees abduction. Significant differences were observed in the EMG activity recorded from the two pairs of electrodes. The EMG activity of the upper subscapularis either remained the same or decreased in going from 0 to 90 degrees abduction, while that of the lower subscapularis increased. The observed differential response confirmed that the electrodes were in different parts of the subscapularis. These preliminary results suggest that in future EMG studies, the subscapularis should be considered as at least two independent muscle units.},

Workers in low force-low repetitive jobs served as an internal comparison population for the three other groups. Videotapes and surface electromyography were used to estimate hand force and repetitiveness. The presence of cumulative trauma disorders (CTD) was determined by structured interview and standardised non-invasive physical examination. Only workers who had been working on the study jobs for at least one year at the time of evaluation were eligible for selection. Categorisation of jobs and identification of CTDs were carried out independently by investigators who were appropriately blinded to exposure and outcome. The analysis of associations between CTDs and exposure categories were performed using Mantel-Haenszel plant adjusted odds ratios and unconditional multiple logistic regression. Significant positive associations were observed between hand wrist CTDs and high force-high repetitive jobs. These associations were independent of age, sex, years on the specific job, and plant.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to provide preliminary measures of the distance between the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis footprints and the acromion, coracoacromial ligament, and coracoid process, during dynamic arm elevations through the entire range-of-motion.
METHODS: Two healthy men performed maximum adduction, flexion, abduction, and extension with the arm internally, neutrally, and externally rotated. The distance between each rotator cuff footprint and the acromion, coracoacromial ligament, and coracoid process was measured from glenohumeral kinematics obtained from markers fitted to intracortical pins combined with the scapular and humeral 3D geometry obtained from CT-scan.
RESULTS: All footprints moved to be less than 10~mm to the acromion, coracoacromial ligament and coracoid process. They got closer to the acromion than to the other parts of the coracoacromial arch. The acromion-supraspinatus and acromion-infraspinatus distances were minimal during abduction and flexion. The acromion-subscapularis distance was minimal when the arm was in external and neutral rotation during both adduction and flexion.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides benchmark results of the distance between the rotator cuff footprints and the coracoacromial arch that may guide future clinical research. Pressure transducers should be positioned throughout the coracoacromial arch to provide comprehensive assessment of the compression undergone by the rotator cuff tendons. Common shoulder examination tests, that require flexion and internal rotation movements, may be refined since the supraspinatus footprint was the closest to the coracoacromial arch during abduction. Larger scale investigations may be needed to identify more accurate shoulder examination tests.},

Muscle moment-arm data for sub-regions of the shoulder musculature during humeral elevation are currently not available. The tendon-excursion method was used to measure instantaneous muscle moment arms in eight entire upper-extremity cadaver specimens. Significant differences in moment arms were reported across sub-regions of the deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, subscapularis, infraspinatus and supraspinatus (P $<$ 0.01). The most effective abductors were the middle and anterior deltoid, whereas the most effective adductors were the teres major, middle and inferior latissimus dorsi (lumbar vertebrae and iliac crest fibers, respectively), and middle and inferior pectoralis major (sternal and lower-costal fibers, respectively). In flexion, the superior pectoralis major (clavicular fibers), anterior and posterior supraspinatus, and anterior deltoid were the most effective flexors, whereas the teres major and posterior deltoid had the largest extensor moment arms. Division of multi-pennate shoulder muscles of broad origins into sub-regions highlighted distinct functional differences across those sub-regions. Most significantly, we found that the superior sub-region of the pectoralis major had the capacity to exert substantial torque in flexion, whereas the middle and inferior sub-regions tended to behave as a stabilizer and extensor, respectively. Knowledge of moment arm differences between muscle sub-regions may assist in identifying the functional effects of muscle sub-region tears, assist surgeons in planning tendon reconstructive surgery, and aid in the development and validation of biomechanical computer models used in implant design.},

We examined the extent of the relationships between the sensory measures of pressure pain threshold (PPT) and cold pain threshold (CPT), catastrophizing, pain and disability levels and gender in acute WAD. Thirty-seven subjects reporting neck pain following a motor vehicle accident were examined within five weeks post-injury. Measures of neck pain and disability (Neck Disability Index, NDI) and catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, PCS) were taken. CPT was assessed in the cervical spine and PPTs were assessed in the cervical spine (PPTcx) and at a remote site (PPTdistal). CPT and PCS were moderately correlated (r=0.46; p $<$ 0.01); however there were no significant relationships between PPT (cervical and distal) and PCS. Both CPT (r=0.55, p $<$ 0.01) and PPTcx (r=-0.42, p $<$ 0.01) were significantly correlated with NDI but PPTdistal was not (r=-0.08, p=0.65). Finally, gender modulated the relationships between sensory measures, catastrophizing, and pain and disability levels. In conclusion, subjects with higher levels of catastrophizing presented with sensory hypersensitivity to cold stimuli in the acute phase of whiplash. Differences between genders are in accordance with the growing body of evidence suggesting that the relationships between some psychological factors and injury-related symptoms are modulated by gender.},

  abstract = {Data on exposure variability is an important remedy for designing and interpreting studies of occupational ergonomics. The present study aimed at retrieving the within- and between-subjects variance of several mechanical exposure parameters in a repeated, short-cycle task. Seven experienced operators repeatedly secured joints using two types of hand-held nutrunners. The joints were placed in three different locations on a rack, simulating automotive assembly. Bilateral muscle activity from the upper trapezius and the lower arm extensors, as well as head and upper arm inclination was continuously monitored. Exposure levels and their variance components were assessed in several data subsets using ANOVA. The results were interpreted in terms of statistical precision and power, and discussed as markers of important ergonomic qualities. A substantial exposure variability was found within and between subjects in all joint locations and for both tools. For mixed work across tools and locations, the necessary number of subjects to arrive at a group mean exposure with 95\% confidence limits corresponding to +/- 10\% of the mean ranged between 8 and 158, with posture recordings tending to require smaller populations than muscle activity recordings. Within-subject variance increased 2- to 37-fold, depending on exposure parameter, when work was 'enlarged' from securings with a specified location and tool to a mix of all locations and tools. Systematic differences between subjects in variability and responsiveness to 'work enlargement' indicated individualized motor control strategies. The results illustrate the importance of exposure variability data to the design of proper measurement strategies. They also suggest that the sizes of exposure variability per se can be interpreted as operational indices of what is thought to be important ergonomic risk indicators, such as the 'sameness' of repeated operations and the allowance for flexible working techniques.},

This unique combination of features in a single model was explored through examination of both experimental and simulated data with the developed analysis tool.

The hypothesis tested was that when the quadriceps muscles were fatigued the lifter would change lifting technique from more of a squat (leg) lift to more of a stoop (back) lift to decrease the demand on the quadriceps muscles. The hypothesis was broadly supported, and three variables changed significantly with fatigue: trunk angular velocity, which increased, and knee moment integral and hip angles, which both decreased. These changes are all consistent with a change from more of a squat toward a stoop technique. The fact that the technique of lifting changes with quadriceps muscle fatigue underlines the importance of the physiologic condition of these muscles and suggests that rehabilitation of low-back-injured workers should include the quadriceps muscles. The amount of work performed should be controlled to avoid the development of local muscle fatigue and subsequent changes in performance.},

  doi = {10.1113/jphysiol.2006.108720},
  abstract = {5${'}$AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor activated by perturbed cellular energy status such as during muscle contraction. Activated AMPK is thought to regulate several key metabolic pathways. We used sex comparison to investigate whether AMPK signalling in skeletal muscle regulates fat oxidation during exercise. Moderately trained women and men completed 90 min bicycle exercise at 60\% V\.O2peak. Both AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation and $\alpha$2AMPK activity were increased by exercise in men ($\sim$200\%, P $<$ 0.001) but not significantly in women. The sex difference in muscle AMPK activation with exercise was accompanied by an increase in muscle free AMP ($\sim$164\%, P $<$ 0.01), free AMP/ATP ratio (159\%, P $<$ 0.05), and creatine ($\sim$42\%, P $<$ 0.001) in men but not in women (NS), suggesting that lack of AMPK activation in women was due to better maintenance of muscle cellular energy balance compared with men. During exercise, fat oxidation per kg lean body mass was higher in women than in men (P $<$ 0.05). Regression analysis revealed that a higher proportion of type 1 muscle fibres ($\sim$23\%, P $<$ 0.01) and a higher capillarization ($\sim$23\%, P $<$ 0.05) in women than in men could partly explain the sex difference in $\alpha$2AMPK activity (r = -0.54, P $<$ 0.05) and fat oxidation (r = 0.64, P $<$ 0.05) during exercise. On the other hand, fat oxidation appeared not to be regulated via AMPK. In conclusion, during prolonged submaximal exercise at 60\% V\.O2peak, higher fat oxidation in women cannot be explained by higher AMPK signalling but is accompanied by improved muscle cellular energy balance in women probably due to sex specific muscle morphology.},

The objective of this paper was to compare two strategies analyzing a single dataset for the relationships between risk factors and MSD in a population-based sample with a wide range of exposures.
METHODS: The 1998 Qu{\'e}bec Health and Social Survey surveyed 11 735 respondents in paid work and reported "significant" musculoskeletal pain in 11 body regions during the previous 12 months and a range of personal, physical, and psychosocial risk factors. Five studies concerning risk factors for four musculoskeletal outcomes were carried out on these data. Each included analyses with multiple logistic regression (MLR) performed separately for women, men, and the total study population. The results from these gender-stratified and unstratified analyses were compared.
RESULTS: In the unstratified MLR models, gender was significantly associated with musculoskeletal pain in the neck and lower extremities, but not with low-back pain. The gender-stratified MLR models identified significant associations between each specific musculoskeletal outcome and a variety of personal characteristics and physical and psychosocial workplace exposures for each gender. Most of the associations, if present for one gender, were also found in the total population. But several risk factors present for only one gender could be detected only in a stratified analysis, whereas the unstratified analysis added little information.
CONCLUSIONS: Stratifying analyses by gender is necessary if a full range of associations between exposures and MSD is to be detected and understood.},

  abstract = {A computerized radiographic technique was used to determine the effect of hamstring antagonist co-contraction on the stability of the joint during isometric knee extension. Data collected from 12 cadaver knees showed that significant anterior displacement and internal rotation of the tibia occurred during isolated quadriceps loading, whereas significant reduction in anterior displacement and rotation occurred upon simultaneous low-level loading of the hamstrings in the range of motion of 15$^\circ$\textendash{}80$^\circ$ flexion. Hamstrings co-contraction was ineffective in the range of 0$^\circ$\textendash{}15$^\circ$ of flexion. Larger hamstrings loads resulted in more pronounced reduction in the anterior displacement and rotation of the tibia. We concluded that hamstring co-contraction has significant effect on maintaining knee stability, providing synergistic action to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) by preventing excessive anterior displacement and internal rotation of the tibia. We also concluded that hamstring strength training is essential therapy in conservative treatment of ACL-deficient knees, as an adjunct therapy to ligament repair procedures and as preventive therapy in high-performance athletes subject to potential risk of ligamentous injuries.},

Thirteen healthy females were recruited to participate in the study. Significant negative correlations were found between HB maximum relative phase angle and leg lifting strength (r~=~-0.805), knee extensor strength (r~=~-0.705), knee flexor strength (r~=~-0.633), back extensor strength (r~=~-0.593) and back flexor strength (r~=~-0.596). The greater the strength of these muscles, the more synchronized the hip-back inter-joint coordination. However, no significant relationships were found with endurance test performance. Moreover, although the lifting task induced muscle fatigue, there were no significant fatigue-induced changes in lifting coordination.},

  volume = {27},
  issn = {0355-3140},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A program called the Project on Research and Intervention in Monotonous Work (PRIM) was initiated in 1994 as a prospective cohort study of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The group-based exposure assessment strategy, focusing on task-related exposure and used to obtain baseline measures of physical exposures, is reported in this paper.
METHODS: Monotonous, repetitive worktasks were evaluated at 19 factories. Tasks with an estimated similarity in physical exposure were aggregated before 103 exposure groups were formed. Subjects from the exposure groups were randomly sampled for measurements, and task-related exposure levels were quantified by 43 single exposure items using a real-time video-based observation method that allowed computerized estimates of repetitiveness, body postures, force, and velocity. In combination with questionnaire-based data on task distribution, the duration of exposure was calculated at the individual level.
RESULTS: The video-based observational method and the large number of exposure variables enabled the establishment of detailed quantitative exposure profiles in 103 task-based exposure groups. However, methodological problems associated with the use of grouped exposure assessment were revealed. Despite efforts to optimize group homogeneity, the within-group variance was larger than the between-group variance for several shoulder postural variables.
CONCLUSIONS: A task-based exposure-assessment strategy can be successful in solving some of the main problems associated with the assessment of physical workplace exposures. The large within-group variance in exposure to nonneutral shoulder postures may eventually require individual assessment or the inclusion of groups with maximal contrast in exposure or both.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To identify prognostic ergonomic and work technique factors for musculoskeletal symptoms among office workers and in a subgroup with highly monotonous repetitive computer work.
METHODS: A baseline questionnaire was delivered to 5033 office workers in 11 Danish companies in the first months of 1999, and a follow up questionnaire was mailed in the last months of 2000 to 3361 respondents. A subgroup with highly monotonous repetitive computer work was formed including those that were repeating the same movements and/or tasks for at least 75\% of the work time. The questionnaire contained questions on ergonomic factors and factors related to work technique. The outcome variables were based on the frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms during the last 12 months. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify prognostic factors for symptoms in the three body regions.
RESULTS: In total, 39\%, 47\%, and 51\% of the symptomatic subjects had a reduced frequency of symptom days in the neck/shoulder, low back, or elbow/hand region, respectively. In all regions more men than women had reduced symptoms. In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, working no more than 75\% of the work time with the computer was a prognostic factor for musculoskeletal symptoms in the neck/shoulder and elbow/hand, and a high influence on the speed of work was a prognostic factor for symptoms in the low back. In the subgroup with highly monotonous repetitive computer work, the odds ratios of the prognostic factors were similar to those for the whole group of office workers.
CONCLUSION: When organising computer work it is important to allow for physical variation with other work tasks, thereby avoiding working with the computer during all the work time, and further to consider the worker's own influence on the speed of work.},

  volume = {15},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of surface height and load weight on upper limb movements and electromyographic (EMG) recordings during manual handling performed by both experienced and inexperienced lifter subjects.
METHODS: Sixteen experienced and sixteen inexperienced lifters handled a box (both 7 and 15 kg) from an intermediate height (waist level) to either a high or low surface. Electromyography and video images were recorded during the tasks. The 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles were calculated for the deltoid and biceps muscles, shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction, and elbow flexion movements. Groups, right/left sides, weights and heights were compared. There were no differences between either groups or sides.
RESULTS: Weight and height variations affected EMG and posture, although weight had more impact on EMG. Shoulder abduction and flexion movements higher than 60\textordmasculine{} occurred, particularly for the higher surface. Shoulder flexion was also higher when the box was moved to the low height. This study provides new evidence as shoulder postures during boxes handling on low surfaces had not previously been evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: The high demand of upper limb in manual material handling tasks is clear, particularly for the shoulder. This knowledge can be used by physical therapists to plan better rehabilitation programs for manual material handling-related disorders, particularly focusing on return to work.},

  issn = {0362-2436},
  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-six subjects underwent biomechanical analysis of freestyle box lifting.
OBJECTIVES: To relate lifting strategy to lower extremity muscle strength and postural stability in functionally limited elders.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Back pain and postural instability in elders is rampant and poorly understood. Much of the literature on lifting relates to young subjects.
METHODS: Lifting strategy for 91 functionally limited elders was classified by timing of peak power in the back and knee joints. Isometric hip and knee extensor strength and postural stability were compared among strategy classifications. Postural stability was analyzed by measuring center of gravity (CG) displacement during lifting.
RESULTS: Three lift strategy groups were established: back-lift, or back dominant strategy (BDS); leg-lift, or leg dominant strategy (LDS); and leg-dominant back-first mixed strategy (LDB). Subjects with relatively strong hip and knee extensors used leg dominant strategy; subjects with relatively strong knee, but weak hip, extensors used leg-dominant back-first mixed strategy; and subjects with weak hip and knee extensors used back dominant strategy. Leg dominant strategy and leg-dominant back-first mixed strategy engendered less center of gravity displacement and thus were posturally more stable than the back dominant strategy.
CONCLUSION: Subjects apparently chose their lift strategy based on their hip and knee extensor strength. Weaker elders using a less stable back dominant strategy could be susceptible to falls and subsequent long bone and vertebral body fractures. Clinicians could identify at-risk elders by muscle testing. Beyond emphasizing strength and endurance exercise in elderly patients, weak elders should be taught to use a leg dominant lifting strategy, or if they are not physically able, to use a combined back/leg strategy.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.01.027},
  abstract = {The surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal that originates in the muscle is inevitably contaminated by various noise signals or artifacts that originate at the skin-electrode interface, in the electronics that amplifies the signals, and in external sources. Modern technology is substantially immune to some of these noises, but not to the baseline noise and the movement artifact noise. These noise sources have frequency spectra that contaminate the low-frequency part of the sEMG frequency spectrum. There are many factors which must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate filter specifications to remove these artifacts; they include the muscle tested and type of contraction, the sensor configuration, and specific noise source. The band-pass determination is always a compromise between (a) reducing noise and artifact contamination, and (b) preserving the desired information from the sEMG signal. This study was designed to investigate the effects of mechanical perturbations and noise that are typically encountered during sEMG recordings in clinical and related applications. The analysis established the relationship between the attenuation rates of the movement artifact and the sEMG signal as a function of the filter band pass. When this relationship is combined with other considerations related to the informational content of the signal, the signal distortion of filters, and the kinds of artifacts evaluated in this study, a Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz and a slope of 12 dB/oct is recommended for general use. The results of this study are relevant to biomechanical and clinical applications where the measurements of body dynamics and kinematics may include artifact sources.},

In the first step, muscle activation dynamics govern the transformation from the neural signal to a measure of muscle activation\textemdash{}a time varying parameter between 0 and 1. In the second step, muscle contraction dynamics characterize how muscle activations are transformed into muscle forces. The third step requires a model of the musculoskeletal geometry to transform muscle forces to joint moments. Finally, the equations of motion allow joint moments to be transformed into joint movements. Each step involves complex nonlinear relationships. The focus of this paper is on the details involved in the first two steps, since these are the most challenging to the biomechanician. The global process is then explained through applications to the study of predicting isometric elbow moments and dynamic knee kinetics.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate gender-specific differences in the pain-induced alterations of muscle activity during sustained contractions of the upper trapezius muscle. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded bilaterally from the upper trapezius muscles of healthy volunteers (10 men and 9 women). The subjects held the arms at 90 degrees abduction for 5 s (short contraction) and 3 min (sustained contraction). These contractions were performed before, during, and after injection of 0.5 ml of hypertonic saline (5.8\%) bilaterally in the upper trapezius muscles. Injection of isotonic saline (0.9\%) served as control. The root mean square (RMS) and mean power frequency (MPF) were computed from the EMG signals and normalized to the values obtained during maximal voluntary contractions. In the short contractions, injection of hypertonic saline, but not isotonic saline, induced a less pronounced decrease in RMS in women than men, and a significant decrease in MPF in men but not women. In the sustained contractions, RMS slope increased and MPF slope decreased (less negative) with muscle pain in men but not women. It was concluded that the pain-induced changes in motor control strategies during sustained contractions differ in men and women, which may partly explain gender differences in the incidence of musculoskeletal pain.},

  abstract = {To explore the cause of higher skeletal muscle fatigue resistance in women than men, we used electrically evoked contractions (1 s on, 1 s off, 30 Hz, 2 min), which circumvent motivational bias and allow examination of contractile properties. We compared 29 men [26.5 (7.0) years old; mean (s.d.)] with 35 women [25.4 (7.6) years old]. Strength of the quadriceps muscle was higher in men than women (P $<$ 0.001). The lower maximal rate of relaxation in women (P = 0.002) indicates that their muscles were slower than those of men. The torque declined less in women than in men [37.7 (10.7) versus 29.9 (10.0)\%; P = 0.002], and was not related to muscle strength or size, as determined with magnetic resonance imaging. The sex difference in fatigability was also seen when the circulation to the leg was occluded [torque declined 76.9 (10.8) versus 59.5 (16.9)\% in men versus women, respectively; P = 0.008]. The maximal rate of relaxation correlated with the fatigability of the muscle under all conditions (correlations ranging from 0.34 to 0.51, P $<$ 0.02). We conclude that the sex-related difference in skeletal muscle fatigue resistance is not explicable by differences in motivation, muscle size, oxidative capacity and/or blood flow between sexes, but might be related to differences in fibre type composition.},

  volume = {35},
  issn = {0355-3140},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether there are gender differences in the effect of exposure to work-related physical and psychosocial risk factors on low back, neck, shoulder, or hand-arm symptoms and related sickness absence.
METHODS: Data of a prospective cohort (study on musculoskeletal disorders, absenteeism stress and health) with a follow-up period of three years were used. Questionnaires were used to assess exposure to risk factors and musculoskeletal symptoms. Sickness absence was registered continuously. Female-to-male gender ratios (GR) were calculated to determine whether there were any differences in the effect. A GR value $>$1.33 or $<$0.75 was regarded as relevant.
RESULTS: Except for the effect of bending the wrist and the neck backwards (GR 1.52-2.55), men generally had a higher risk of symptoms (GR range 0.50-0.68) with equal exposure. For sickness absence, a GR value of $>$1.33 was found for twisting the upper body, working in uncomfortable postures, twisting the wrist, bending the neck backwards, and coworker and supervisor support (GR range 1.66-2.63). For driving vehicles, hand-arm vibration, squeezing, working above shoulder level or below knee level, reaching, twisting the neck, job demands, and skill discretion, the GR value was $<$0.75. For job satisfaction, a GR value of 0.50 was found for absence due to back symptoms, while the GR value was 1.78 for sickness absence due to neck, shoulder, or hand-arm symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Although women are expected to be more vulnerable to exposure to work-related risk factors, the results of this study show that, in many cases, men are more vulnerable. This study could not explain the gender difference in musculoskeletal symptoms among workers.},

  abstract = {Four shoulder muscles (the supraspinatus, the infraspinatus, the anterior and middle portion of the deltoid, and the descending part of the trapezius) were examined with electromyography in abducted arm positions. By using feedback techniques, we found that the subjects could reduce the EMG activity voluntarily by 22-47\% in the trapezius muscle while keeping different static postures. This was not true for any other muscle investigated. When the trapezius activity was reduced there was a tendency towards an increase of EMG activity in some other shoulder muscles, particularly the infraspinatus. The findings may be related to relaxation from an initial overstabilization of the shoulder, or redistribution of load among synergists. It is suggested that the possibility of reducing trapezius activity may be of ergonomic significance. It is also noted that EMG trapezius activity may not serve as a universal descriptor of total muscular load in the shoulder.},

  volume = {36},
  issn = {1795-990X},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide a quantitative assessment of the exposure-response relationships between work-related physical and psychosocial factors and the occurrence of specific shoulder disorders in occupational populations.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted on the associations between type of work, physical load factors, and psychosocial aspects at work, on the one hand, and the occurrence of tendinitis of the biceps tendon, rotator cuff tears, subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS), and suprascapular nerve compression, on the other hand. Associations between work factors and shoulder disorders were expressed in quantitative measures as odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR).
RESULTS: The occurrence of SIS was associated with force requirements $>$10\% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), lifting $>$20 kg $>$10 times/day, and high-level of hand force $>$1 hour/day (OR 2.8-4.2). Repetitive movements of the shoulder, repetitive motion of the hand/wrist $>$2 hours/day, hand-arm vibration, and working with hand above shoulder level showed an association with SIS (OR 1.04-4.7) as did upper-arm flexion $>$ or =45 degrees $>$ or =15\% of time (OR 2.43) and duty cycle of forceful exertions $>$ or =9\% time or duty cycle of forceful pinch $>$0\% of time (OR 2.66). High psychosocial job demand was also associated with SIS (OR 1.5-3.19). Jobs in the fish processing industry had the highest risk for both tendinitis of the biceps tendon as well as SIS (OR 2.28 and 3.38, respectively). Work in a slaughterhouse and as a betel pepper leaf culler were associated with the occurrence of SIS only (OR 5.27 and 4.68, respectively). None of the included articles described the association between job title/risk factors and the occurrence of rotator cuff tears or suprascapular nerve compression.
CONCLUSIONS: Highly repetitive work, forceful exertion in work, awkward postures, and high psychosocial job demand are associated with the occurrence of SIS.},

  abstract = {Risk factors for work-associated strain or sprain back injuries were investigated in a cohort of 31,076 material handlers from 260 retail merchandise stores in the United States. The workers studied were those with significant material-handling responsibilities--daily lifting and movement of merchandise. Workers in jobs with the greatest physical work requirements had an injury rate of 3.64 per 100 person-years versus 1.82 in workers with lesser work requirements. The unadjusted injury rate for males was 3.67 per 100 person-years compared with 2.34 per 100 person-years for females, but the excess for males was confounded by higher physical work requirements for men in the stocker/receiver job category. The injury rate ratio for short versus long duration of employment was 3.53 (95\% confidence interval: 2.90, 4.30); for medium versus long duration of employment, it was 1.38 (95\% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.62). The elevated rate ratios were maintained when the data were stratified by subsets with different rates of turnover. The results suggest that workers with the greatest physical work requirements and those with the shortest duration of employment are at the highest risk of back injuries. However, selection forces causing worker turnover within this cohort of active workers are not well characterized and have the potential to bias the measures for time-related factors such as duration of employment.},

The aging of the workforce and the increased diffusion of physically demanding jobs contribute to the widespread concern about musculoskeletal disorders.The effective prevention of work related musculoskeletal disorders needs a multidisciplinary approach, drawing together experience from backgrounds in engineering, mechanics, physiology, occupational medicine and psychology; all considered in the context of ergonomics.This book is a collection of lectures on both back and upper limb musculoskeletal disorders presented at an International Course sponsored by the Nordic Institute for Advanced Training in Occupational Health (NIVA), and the University of Bologna in September 1999. The lectures were given by renowned international researchers on the subject and therefore the book provides a comprehensive overview of all critical issues related to musculoskeletal disorders at work. The book forms an update to the latest research in the field and will interest a wide range of professionals and researchers in ergonomics as well as in the fields from which the material is drawn.The book covers the main topics addressed in dealing with occupational ergonomics including: " occupational biomechanics * physiology * epidemiology * psychosocial issues * medical diagnosis and management * ergonomic solutions},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relative influence of such factors as age, gender, and absolute force on the fatiguability of the human adductor pollicis muscle. 12 young males (YM, 25.3 +/- 2.1 y), 12 young females (YF. 23.5 +/- 2.1 y), 12 older males (OM, 71.7 +/- 5.6 y) and 12 older females (OF, 69.5 +/- 4.6 y) participated. Three minutes of intermittent (5 s contraction, 2 s rest) maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) were used to fatigue the adductor pollicis muscle; the ulnar nerve was also stimulated in each 2 s rest period to evoke a maximal twitch. Males were stronger than females in both voluntary and evoked force (PT) in the young age group (MVC: YM, 10.0 +/- 2.7 kg vs. YF, 6.6 +/- 1.1 kg, P $<$ 0.05) (PT: YM, 0.99 +/- 0.21 kg vs. YF, 0.71 +/- 0.12 kg, P $<$ 0.05). In the older adults, however, males were stronger only in the evoked twitch (OM, 0.73 +/- 0.24 kg vs. OF, 0.48 +/- 0.07 kg, P $<$ 0.05). There was no significant effect of gender or absolute muscle force on relative fatigability; the only variable found to significantly affect fatigability was age. Older adults were significantly less fatigable than young adults as indicated by the voluntary fatigue index (FI) (percentage of force reduction from baseline; FI-young, 40.2 +/- 12.6\% vs. FI-old, 25.2 +/- 12.3\%). This age effect, however, was more prominent in males than females (FI-YM, 44.7 +/- 10.5\% vs. FI-OM, 24.2 +/- 10.7\%, P $<$ 0.01; FI-YF, 37.8 +/- 14.1\% vs. FI-OF, 26.3 +/- 14.5\%, P = 0.13). In conclusion, age was found to be the strongest single predictor of fatigability during short duration, intermittent exercise in human adductor pollicis muscle.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND\textemdash{}Epidemiologically-based rheumatology healthcare needs assessment requires an understanding of the incidence and prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in the community, of the reasons why people consult in primary care, and of the proportion of people who would benefit from referral to secondary care and paramedical services. This paper reports the first phase of such a needs assessment exercise. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE\textemdash{}To estimate the relative frequency of musculoskeletal pain in different, and multiple, anatomical sites in the adult population. SETTING\textemdash{}Three general practices in the former Tameside and Glossop Health Authority, Greater Manchester, UK, a predominantly urban area. DESIGN\textemdash{}Population survey. METHODS\textemdash{}An age and sex stratified sample of 6000~adults from the three practices was mailed a questionnaire that sought data on demographic factors, musculoskeletal symptoms (pain in the past month lasting for more than a week), and physical disability (using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire- mHAQ). The areas of pain covered were neck, back, shoulder, elbow, hand, hip, knee, and multiple joints. The Carstairs index was used as a measure of social deprivation of the postcode sector in which the person lived. RESULTS\textemdash{}The response rate after two reminders was 78.5\%. Non-responders were more likely to live in areas of high social deprivation. People who lived in more deprived areas were also more likely to report musculoskeletal pain, especially backpain. After adjusting for social deprivation the rates of musculoskeletal pain did not differ between the practices and so their results were combined. After adjustment for social deprivation, the most common site of pain was back (23\%; 95\% CI 21,~25) followed by knee (19\%; 95\% CI 18,~21), and shoulder (16\%; 95\% CI 14,~17). The majority of subjects who reported pain had pain in more than one site. The prevalence of physical disability in the community rose with age. It was highest in those with multiple joint problems but was also high in those with isolated back or knee pain. CONCLUSION\textemdash{}Musculoskeletal pain is common in the community. People who live in socially deprived areas have more musculoskeletal symptoms. Estimates of the overall burden of musculoskeletal pain that combine the results of site specific surveys will be too high, those that do not adjust for socioeconomic factors will be too low.    Keywords: prevalence; pain; social deprivation},

Over the past 20-30 yr, it has been increasingly recognized that this narrow approach has missed an important variable: sex. An ever-increasing number of studies have established sex differences in response to pain and analgesics. These studies have demonstrated that the differences between the sexes appear to have a biological and psychological basis. We will provide brief review of the epidemiology, rodent, and human experimental findings. The controversies and widespread disagreement in the literature highlight the need for a progressive approach to the questions involving collaborative efforts between those trained in the basic and clinical biomedical sciences and those in the epidemiological and social sciences. In order for patients suffering from acute and/or chronic pain to benefit from this work, the approach has to involve the use or development of clinically relevant models of nociception or pain to answer the basic, but complex, question. The present state of the literature allows no translation of the work to our clinical decision-making.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the mechanisms leading to chronic neck-shoulder musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). The aim of the present study was to investigate and compare motor function during controlled, low load, repetitive work together with chronic or acute experimental neck-shoulder pain. The clinical study was performed on workers with (n = 12) and without (n = 6) chronic neck-shoulder pain. In the experimental study, experimental muscle pain was induced in healthy subjects by intra-muscular injection of hypertonic saline into the trapezius muscle (n = 10). The assessed parameters related to motor performance were: work task event duration, cutting forces, surface electromyogram (EMG) activity in four shoulder muscles, displacement of the centre of pressure, and arm and trunk 3D movements. For controlled cutting force levels, chronic and acute experimental pain provoked a series of changes: a decreased working rhythm and a protective reorganisation of muscle synergy (experimental study), higher EMG frequency contents which may indicate altered motor unit recruitment, and greater postural activity and a tendency towards increased arm and trunk movements. These pain-related changes can play a role in the development of MSD. The present clinical and experimental study demonstrated similar interactions between motor co-ordination and neck-shoulder pain in occupational settings. We therefore suggest that this experimental model can be used to study mechanisms related to MSD. Information on such modulatory processes may help in the design of new strategies aimed at reducing the development of MSD.},

  abstract = {This review describes how computational modeling can be combined with noninvasive gait measurements to describe and explain muscle and joint function in human locomotion. Five muscles--the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vasti, soleus, and gastrocnemius--contribute most significantly to the accelerations of the center of mass in the vertical, fore-aft, and medio-lateral directions when humans walk and run at their preferred speeds. Humans choose to switch from a walk to a run at speeds near 2 m s(-1) to enhance the biomechanical performance of the ankle plantarflexors and to improve coordination of the knee and ankle muscles during stance. Muscles that do not span a joint can contribute to the contact force transmitted by that joint and therefore affect its stability. In walking, for example, uniarticular muscles that cross the hip and ankle act to create the adduction moment at the knee, thereby contributing to the contact force present in the medial compartment.},

  volume = {36},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined the relationship of repetitive work and other physical stressors to prevalence of upper limb discomfort, tendinitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
METHODS: Three hundred fifty-two workers from three companies participated. Job exposure levels for repetition and other physical stressors were quantified using an observational rating technique. Ergonomic exposures were rated on a 10-point scale, where 0 corresponded to no stress and 10 corresponded to maximum stress. Job selection was based on repetition (three categories: high, medium, and low) to ensure a wide range of exposures. Physical evaluations on all participating workers were performed by medical professionals and included a self-administered questionnaire, physical exam, and limited electrodiagnostic testing.
RESULTS: Repetitiveness of work was found to be significantly associated with prevalence of reported discomfort in the wrist, hand, or fingers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.17 per unit of repetition; OR = 2.45 for high vs. low repetition), tendinitis in the distal upper extremity (OR = 1.23 per unit of repetition; OR = 3.23 for high vs. low repetition), and symptoms consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (OR = 1.16 per unit of repetition; OR = 2.32 for high vs. low repetition). An association was also found between repetitiveness of work and carpal tunnel syndrome, indicated by the combination of positive electrodiagnostic results and symptoms consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome (OR = 1. 22 per unit of repetition; OR = 3.11 for high vs. low repetition).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that repetitive work is related to upper limb discomfort, tendinitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome in workers. Further research with a wider range of exposures is needed to evaluate the effects of other physical stresses alone and in combination.},

  abstract = {Strength and muscle characteristics were examined in biceps brachii and vastus lateralis of eight men and eight women. Measurements included motor unit number, size and activation and voluntary strength of the elbow flexors and knee extensors. Fiber areas and type were determined from needle biopsies and muscle areas by computerized tomographical scanning. The women were approximately 52\% and 66\% as strong as the men in the upper and lower body respectively. The men were also stronger relative to lean body mass. A significant correlation was found between strength and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA; P $<$ or = 0.05). The women had 45, 41, 30 and 25\% smaller muscle CSAs for the biceps brachii, total elbow flexors, vastus lateralis and total knee extensors respectively. The men had significantly larger type I fiber areas (4597 vs 3483 microns2) and mean fiber areas (6632 vs 3963 microns2) than the women in biceps brachii and significantly larger type II fiber areas (7700 vs 4040 microns2) and mean fiber areas (7070 vs 4290 microns2) in vastus lateralis. No significant gender difference was found in the strength to CSA ratio for elbow flexion or knee extension, in biceps fiber number (180,620 in men vs 156,872 in women), muscle area to fiber area ratio in the vastus lateralis 451,468 vs 465,007) or any motor unit characteristics. Data suggest that the greater strength of the men was due primarily to larger fibers. The greater gender difference in upper body strength can probably be attributed to the fact that women tend to have a lower proportion of their lean tissue distributed in the upper body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

One convenient method involves placing a single marker on the skin overlying the acromion. The purpose of this study was to compare translatory discrepancies between marker and underlying bone for seven markers affixed to the skin overlying different parts of the scapula.
METHODS: The markers were small plastic spheres filled with machine oil, clearly visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), placed over seven loci of the scapula, including the acromion, spine, medial border, lateral border, and inferior angle. Nine healthy men participated, assuming three positions in the MRI apparatus: (1) arm at the side of the trunk (starting position); (2) arm in full elevation over the head; and (3) hand placed behind the back at the thoracolumbar area. Visible markers and three loci of the scapula itself were digitized on each MRI scan, enabling calculation of changes in location of each marker relative to the scapula between the starting position and either of the other two positions.
RESULTS: Among the seven loci examined, the marker placed atop the acromion deviated least from its target, 39 +/- 1 mm (mean +/- standard deviation) for full elevation and 15 +/- 1 mm for moving the hand behind the back. Markers along the medial border and at the inferior angle exhibited relatively large deviations, on the order of 8 mm for full elevation and 3 mm for moving the hand behind the back.
CONCLUSIONS: For the two movements studied, involving full range of motion in the shoulder complex, translation of the scapula is most accurately recorded if the marker is placed over the acromion, but the systematic error is too large for such tracking to be deemed precise.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of upper-limb kinematic data acquired from optoelectronic systems with retro-reflective markers is poor, mainly due to soft tissue artefact (STA). For the upper-arm, humeral internal/external rotation (HIER) is the movement most affected by STA, which is measured as a percentile fraction (K) of the effective humeral axial rotation performed. The aim of this work was to quantify STA during HIERs, with independently varying attitude of the humerus and elbow flexion, and to test the possibility of estimating its mean value over the tested upper-limb orientations using one simple trial. Six able-bodied subjects performed a series of HIERs in combination with elbow flexion for different humeral planes and degrees of elevation. During the trials the instantaneous attitudes of two humeral anatomical frames were compared, one being affected by the STA to be measured, and the other assumed as the gold standard. K was found to range from 20\% to 48\% of the effective humeral axial rotation performed, depending on the subject, humeral attitude and elbow flexion. These last two factors comparably affect STA and resulted in mean K coefficients of variation among the subjects of about 9\% and 7\%, respectively. Common patterns of K with elbow flexion and humerus elevation are discussed. The data also show that the mean of K of a subject is very close to the value assessed in a specific upper-limb configuration consistent among the subjects. This result from this study could be used to build up a time-saving STA compensation procedure suitable for clinical applications.},

  abstract = {A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension. After rat kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical cell suspensions were obtained. Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer containing 0.5\% deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel filtered on Sephadex G-25. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate buffer. Subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors, bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned. Calculated yields were about 70\% of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell homogenates. Recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged from 83-108\% (mean 96\%). Using this technique, it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from 0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2) alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe) esterase units per 10(8) cells. However, cells incubated in a nutrient medium at 37 degrees C for 3-8 h contained no measurable kallikrein activity, whereas the surrounding medium had kallikrein activity which could be significantly increased by aldosterone and decreased by spironolactone.},

This is a joint initiative of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), the Council of Musculoskeletal Specialty Societies (COMSS), and the Institute for Work and Health (Toronto, Ontario). Our approach is consistent with previously described strategies for scale development. In Stage 1, Item Generation, a group of methodologists and clinical experts reviewed 13 outcome measurement scales currently in use and generated a list of 821 items. In Stage 2a, Initial Item Reduction, these 821 items were reduced to 78 items using various strategies including removal of items which were generic, repetitive, not reflective of disability, or not relevant to the upper extremity or to one of the targeted concepts of symptoms and functional status. Items not highly endorsed in a survey of content experts were also eliminated. Stage 2b, Further Item Reduction, will be based on results of field testing in which patients complete the 78-item questionnaire. This field testing, which is currently underway in 20 centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia, will generate the final format and content of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire.

  abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: The Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale is a 20-item self-administered instrument designed to assess the level of functional disability in individuals with back pain. The scale was administered as part of a larger questionnaire to a group of 242 back pain patients. Follow-up data were obtained after several days and after 2 to 6 months.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to determine whether the Quebec scale is a reliable, valid, and responsive measure of disability in back pain, and to compare it with other disability scales.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A number of functional disability scales for back pain are being used, but their conceptual validity is uncertain. Unlike most published instruments, the Quebec scale was constructed using a conceptual approach to disability assessment and empirical methods of item development, analysis, and selection.
METHODS: The authors calculated test-retest and internal consistency coefficients, evaluated construct validity of the scale, and tested its responsiveness against a global index of change. Direct comparisons with the Roland, Oswestry, and SF-36 scales were carried out.
RESULTS: Test-retest reliability was 0.92, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.96. The scale correlated as expected with other measures of disability, pain, medical history, and utilization variables, work-related variables, and socio-demographic characteristics. Significant changes in disability over time, and differences in change scores between patients that were expected to differ in the direction of change, were found.
CONCLUSIONS: The Quebec scale can be recommended as an outcome measure in clinical trials, and for monitoring the progress of individual patients participating in treatment or rehabilitation programs.},

To reduce unnecessary exclusions, an expert committee established by Fitness Canada has now revised the questionnaire wording. The present study compares responses to the original and the revised PAR-Q questionnaire in 399 men and women attending 40 accredited fitness testing centres across Canada. The number of subjects screened out by the revised test decreased significantly (p $<$ .05), from 68 to 48 of the 399 subjects. The change reflects in part the inclusion of individuals who had made an erroneous positive response to the original question regarding high blood pressure. There is no simple gold standard to provide an objective evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of either questionnaire format, but the revised wording has apparently had the intended effect of reducing positive responses, particularly to the question regarding an elevation of blood pressure.},

  abstract = {Axes of rotation e.g. at the knee, are often generated from clinical gait analysis data to be used in the assessment of kinematic abnormalities, the diagnosis of disease, or the ongoing monitoring of a patient's condition. They are additionally used in musculoskeletal models to aid in the description of joint and segment kinematics for patient specific analyses. Currently available methods to describe joint axes from segment marker positions share the problem that when one segment is transformed into the coordinate system of another, artefacts associated with motion of the markers relative to the bone can become magnified. In an attempt to address this problem, a symmetrical axis of rotation approach (SARA) is presented here to determine a unique axis of rotation that can consider the movement of two dynamic body segments simultaneously, and then compared its performance in a survey against a number of previously proposed techniques. Using a generated virtual joint, with superimposed marker error conditions to represent skin movement artefacts, fitting methods (geometric axis fit, cylinder axis fit, algebraic axis fit) and transformation techniques (axis transformation technique, mean helical axis, Schwartz approach) were classified and compared with the SARA. Nearly all approaches were able to estimate the axis of rotation to within an RMS error of 0.1cm at large ranges of motion (90 degrees ). Although the geometric axis fit produced the least RMS error of approximately 1.2 cm at lower ranges of motion (5 degrees ) with a stationary axis, the SARA and Axis Transformation Technique outperformed all other approaches under the most demanding marker artefact conditions for all ranges of motion. The cylinder and algebraic axis fit approaches were unable to compute competitive AoR estimates. Whilst these initial results using the SARA are promising and are fast enough to be determined "on-line", the technique must now be proven in a clinical environment.},

  volume = {450},
  issn = {0006-3002},
  abstract = {The final step in the biosynthesis of testosterone is the reduction of androstenedione, which is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme 17-ketosteroid reductase. Evidence is presented which suggests that there are two distinct 17-ketosteroid reductases in rat testes, one in interstitial tissue and one in seminiferous tubules. The two enzymes have different pH optima, 5.6 for the one from interstitial tissue and 6.5 for the one from seminiferous tubules. At the optimum pH, a 70-fold difference in Km values was observed, 17 muM for the interstitial tissue enzyme and 0.25 muM for the enzyme from seminiferous tubules. Testosterone and metabolites of testosterone have very different effects of each of these enzyme activities. The interstitial tissue enzyme activity is inhibited by testosterone and several 5alpha-reduced metabolites of testosterone and by estrogens. The most potent inhibitor of the steroids investigated was 5alpha-androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol, followed by 17beta-estradiol approximately equal to dihydrotestosterone greater than testosterone greater than estrone greater than estriol. 5alpha-Androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol and 17beta-estradiol were shown to act by competitive inhibition with apparent Ki values of 2.2 and 3.7 muM, respectively. In contrast, it was demonstrated that among the above steroids, only dihydrotestosterone inhibits the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules and this inhibition was only observed at very high concentrations of inhibitor. Testosterone stimulated the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules. 5alpha-Androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol at low concentrations stimulated the enzyme activity from seminiferous tubules, while it had no effect at high concentrations. The remainder of the steroids tested had no effect on the 17-ketosteroid reductase activity of seminiferous tubules. The difference in response of the two enzyme activities suggests a mechanism for local regulation of testosterone synthesis in each testicular compartment that does not involve directly pituitary gonadotropins.},

  title = {Use of {{Kinematics}} to {{Minimize Construction Workers}}' {{Risk}} of {{Musculoskeletal Injury}}},
  abstract = {Construction work requires more repetitive and highly physical effort than, for example, office work. Despite technological advancements in construction, the human factor is still an essential part of the industry. Hence, the need to maintain a healthy work environment is a shared interest between workers and industry. This thesis addresses the problem of cumulative injuries among construction workers, with emphasis on masons, and examines ways to improve safety and productivity simultaneously.

Vision-based motion capture and sensor-based joint angle measurement techniques were tested against a state-of-the-art Optotrak system. Results show that the overall error in joint angle measurements was 10 deg for vision-based approaches compared to 3 deg for optical encoders. Moreover, a noninvasive fatigue detection method was developed by applying time-delay embedding and  phase-space warping (PSW) techniques to a single joint angle, exerted force, and electromyography (EMG) data. Results indicate that the method can detect a slowly changing variable, fatigue in a limb, from a single kinematic signal, limb exerted force, or its EMG signals.

Furthermore, twenty one masons distributed in four experience categories, ranging from novice to expert, took part in a study to evaluate safety and productivity in masonry work using inertial measurement units (IMUs). The study hypothesized that masons adopt safer and more productive work techniques with experience and that these techniques can be identified and used to train novice workers. Results indicate that journeymen appear to develop more productive and safer work techniques compared to other groups. On the other hand, the three-years experience group was found to sustain the highest joint compression forces and moments. Results also show that a clear distinction exists between expert and inexpert mason motion patterns. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were able to identify these differences with an accuracy of \%92.04 in 13 seconds using a linear kernel.

The thesis findings justify exploration of sensor fusion techniques to combine direct and indirect motion capture systems. The findings also suggest that PSW can be used in applications such as rehabilitation to access information about patient status hidden in the full-chain kinematics using a single kinematic signal. Finally, findings show the potential for training apprentices to excel in all three aspects: proficiency, productivity, and ergonomic safety by following the example of experts.},

  abstract = {Over 80\% of dentists report having some type of back, neck or shoulder pain. Research has identified significant costs linked to a very high rate of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) associated with poor ergonomic positioning in dentists. The annual costs of WMSDs across all occupations are estimated to be between 13 and 54 billion dollars. Little research has been done to explore the design of portable, inexpensive, non-invasive and unobtrusive real-time systems to measure posture. This paper details the design and testing of our proposed system that applies signal processing and robust machine learning techniques to improve the ergonomics of dental practitioners. We outline a number of different signal processing and classification techniques tested and analytically compared with our proposed system. Our system makes use of commercial inclinometers embedded into a standard laboratory coat. The ability of the system to measure posture accurately in practical settings, without needing exact and obtrusive placement of sensors or extensive calibration, is demonstrated through a set of experiments with human subjects.},

  abstract = {Finite element (FE) analysis is an important computational tool in biomechanics. However, its adoption into clinical practice has been hampered by its computational complexity and required high technical competences for clinicians. In this paper we propose a supervised learning approach to predict the outcome of the FE analysis. We demonstrate our approach on clinical CT and X-ray femur images for FE predictions (FEP), with features extracted, respectively, from a statistical shape model and from 2D-based morphometric and density information. Using leave-one-out experiments and sensitivity analysis, comprising a database of 89 clinical cases, our method is capable of predicting the distribution of stress values for a walking loading condition with an average correlation coefficient of 0.984 and 0.976, for CT and X-ray images, respectively. These findings suggest that supervised learning approaches have the potential to leverage the clinical integration of mechanical simulations for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions.},

In this paper, we investigate if machine-learning classifiers offer the discriminative power for the diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. We compared Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) on 72 participants (36 AD patients and 36 healthy subjects) exposed to seven increasingly difficult postural tasks. The decisional space was composed of 18 kinematic variables (adjusted for age, education, height, and weight), with or without neuropsychological evaluation (Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score), top ranked in an error incremental analysis. Classification results were based on threefold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs sets: training (50\%), test (40\%), and validation (10\%). Having a decisional space relying solely on postural kinematics, accuracy of AD diagnosis ranged from 71.7 to 86.1\%. Adding the MoCA variable, the accuracy ranged between 91 and 96.6\%. MLP classifier achieved top performance in both decisional spaces. Having comprehended the interdynamic interaction between postural stability and cognitive performance, our results endorse machine-learning models as a useful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics.},

  volume = {80},
  issn = {0031-9023},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment of patients with impingement symptoms commonly includes exercises intended to restore "normal" movement patterns. Evidence that indicates the existence of abnormal patterns in people with shoulder pain is limited. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze glenohumeral and scapulothoracic kinematics and associated scapulothoracic muscle activity in a group of subjects with symptoms of shoulder impingement relative to a group of subjects without symptoms of shoulder impingement matched for occupational exposure to overhead work.
SUBJECTS: Fifty-two subjects were recruited from a population of construction workers with routine exposure to overhead work.
METHODS: Surface electromyographic data were collected from the upper and lower parts of the trapezius muscle and from the serratus anterior muscle. Electromagnetic sensors simultaneously tracked 3-dimensional motion of the trunk, scapula, and humerus during humeral elevation in the scapular plane in 3 handheld load conditions: (1) no load, (2) 2. 3-kg load, and (3) 4.6-kg load. An analysis of variance model was used to test for group and load effects for 3 phases of motion (31(-60(, 61(-90(, and 91(-120().
RESULTS: Relative to the group without impingement, the group with impingement showed decreased scapular upward rotation at the end of the first of the 3 phases of interest, increased anterior tipping at the end of the third phase of interest, and increased scapular medial rotation under the load conditions. At the same time, upper and lower trapezius muscle electromyographic activity increased in the group with impingement as compared with the group without impingement in the final 2 phases, although the upper trapezius muscle changes were apparent only during the 4.6-kg load condition. The serratus anterior muscle demonstrated decreased activity in the group with impingement across all loads and phases.
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: Scapular tipping (rotation about a medial to lateral axis) and serratus anterior muscle function are important to consider in the rehabilitation of patients with symptoms of shoulder impingement related to occupational exposure to overhead work.

Shoulder kinematics was recorded while subjects performed elevation in the sagittal and scapular planes. Euler angles were computed for scapular and humeral elevation. Data were divided into 3 equal phases. Lines were fit and the slope determined for each phase. Significant differences in slopes ( P $<$ .05) were found between experimental groups for both motions. The RCT group had higher slopes in the initial and middle phases for sagittal elevation and in the middle phase for scapular abduction. The scapula was elevated more in the RCT group in the initial two thirds of movement. This motion may change the length of remaining muscles so that they operate on a more effective part of their length-tension curve.},

  doi = {10.1080/001401397187757},
  abstract = {Co-ordination of various components of the human body during the course of lifting are very complex and difficult to control. This study hypothesized that strategies used to control the motion patterns of the external load may be applied to control co-ordination and also to control the level of compressive force on the lumbosacral joint. A simulation of lifting based on the optimization approach was introduced to generate three classes of unique dynamic motion patterns of the external load directed by three different objective functions. The first objective function was to maximize the smoothness of the motion pattern of the external load. The second objective function was to minimize the sudden change of the centre of gravity of the body-load system. The third objective was to minimize the integration over time of the sum of the square of the ratio of the predicted joint moments to the corresponding joint strength during the course of lifting. Eight subjects were recruited to perform 40 lifts using each of the three optimal motion patterns of the load. Compressive forces on the lumbosacral joint were computed and compared. The data showed with statistical significance that subjects using the motion patterns of the external load suggested by the first objective function had the lowest compressive force peaks. Thus, this study satisfied two goals: (1) it indexed and synthesized three motion patterns of the external load by three biomechanically unique objective functions, and (2) it established the association between the spinal loading and the control of the motion patterns of the external load during lifting.},

  abstract = {The pattern of movement self-selected by 39 subjects to lift light loads from 9 cm above the ground is described in kinematic and electromyographic terms. Hamstring length changes were estimated from hip and knee angular kinematics. Subjects adopted a posture at the start of the lift intermediate between stoop and full-squat postures. A consistent coordination between knee, hip, and lumbar vertebral joints during lifting was described through calculation of the relative phase between adjacent joints and found to be exaggerated with increases in load mass. During the early phase of lifting, knee extension leads hip extension, which in turn leads extension of the lumbar vertebral joints. Early in the lifting movement, when load acceleration is greatest, the erectores spinae are thus relatively long and shortening slowly. Both of these factors produce greater back extensor strength. Rapid hamstring shortening is also delayed, which enhances their strength, and coactivation of the monoarticular knee extensors and biarticular hamstring observed early in the lifting movement suggested that the knee extensors contribute to hip extension through a tendinous action of the hamstrings.},

This was done to help explain the proximal-to-distal sequential pattern of segment motions typically observed in these activities and to evaluate general biomechanical principles used to explain this motion pattern. High speed film data were collected for four subjects performing each skill. Equations were derived which expressed the interaction between segments in terms of resultant joint moments at the hip and knee and several interactive moments which were functions of gravitational forces or kinematic variables. The angular motion-dependent interaction between the thigh and leg was found to play a significant role in determining the sequential segment motion patterns observed in all three activities. The general nature of this interaction was consistent across all three movements except during phases in which there were large differences in the knee angle. Support was found for the principle of summation of segment speeds, whereas no support was found for the principle of summation of force or for general statements concerning the effect of negative thigh acceleration on positive leg acceleration. The roles played by resultant joint moments in producing the observed segment motion sequences are discussed.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional cinematography and the direct linear transformation method were used to obtain the coordinates of the landmarks of five right-handed collegiate tennis players. A 15-segment model was used to calculate the total body angular momentum about three orthogonal axes (X, parallel to the baseline; Y, normal to baseline and pointing towards the net; and Z, pointing upwards) passing through the centre of mass and to obtain the segmental contribution of the trunk, arms and legs. Most of the clockwise angular momentum about the X-axis was concentrated in the trunk and the racket-arm. Between the events of maximum external rotation and ball impact, the clockwise angular momentum about the X-axis of rotation of most body segments was reduced and the racket-arm gained clockwise angular momentum. The body angular momentum about the Y-axis of rotation had two distinct patterns and was the result of the lateral rotation of the trunk as the racket shoulder was elevated in preparation for impact. This body angular momentum was clockwise from the event of maximum external rotation to impact for the players with the greatest ball speed, whereas it was counterclockwise for the other players. The angular momentum about the Z-axis of rotation was small and lacked a consistent pattern. The largest source of angular momentum in the tennis serve derives from the remote angular momentum about the X- and Y-axes of rotation, which are then transferred from the trunk to the racket-arm and finally to the racket. Near impact, most of the angular momentum (75.1\%) was concentrated in the racket-arm. Of the angular momentum of the racket-arm, the largest percentages were concentrated in the racket (35.9\%) and the forearm segment (25.7\%).},

  abstract = {Many medical procedures require fine motor skills, and these skills are developed over years of practice and through performing hundreds to thousands of procedures. However medical training that is based upon gaining this expertise by performing procedures on patients results in unnecessary risk to the patient. In this project expert medical skill is quantified, so that advanced medical simulators can be created to provide a realistic training environment. This approach is applied to airway intubation with a rigid laryngoscope; a procedure that is performed prior to general anesthesia and during emergency situations. A laryngoscope has been instrumented with a 3 dimensional force/torque sensor, and magnetic position sensors have been placed on the laryngoscope and the patient. Measurements are made in the operating room of both experts and novices as they perform laryngoscopy on consenting patients undergoing general anesthesia. The skill of the laryngoscopist is represented by the motion and force trajectories applied to the laryngoscope during the procedure. Preliminary results show that novices often err in the placement of the tip of the laryngoscope blade. However, when two experts perform laryngoscopy on the same patient, both experts perform key elements of the task consistently. The measured consistency among experts indicates that it will be possible to apply algorithms developed for Human Skill Acquisition, and thereby define regions of expert motion relative to patient anatomy. This is the first step in developing advanced training simulators that will simulate the procedure accurately, provide guidance to the trainee, and can be used for assessment of medical skill.},

  abstract = {Thirty-five healthy women, experienced in pipetting, each performed four pipetting sessions at different pace and accuracy levels relevant to occupational tasks. The size and structure of motor variability of shoulder and elbow joint angles were quantified using cycle-to-cycle standard deviations of several kinematics properties, and indices based on sample entropy and recurrence quantification analysis. Decreasing accuracy demands increased both the size and structure of motor variability. However, when simultaneously lowering the accuracy demand and increasing pace, motor variability decreased to values comparable to those found when pace alone was increased without changing accuracy. Thus, motor variability showed some speed-accuracy trade-off, but the pace effect dominated the accuracy effect. Hence, this trade-off was different from that described for end-point performance by Fitts' law. The combined effect of accuracy and pace and the resultant decrease in motor variability are important to consider when designing sustainable work systems comprising repetitive precision tasks.
PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: Variability in movements and/or muscle activities between repeats of the same repetitive task is associated with important occupational outcomes, including fatigue, discomfort and pain. This study showed that simultaneously decreasing accuracy and increasing pace in short-cycle repetitive work led to decreased motor variability in arm movements, indicating less favourable ergonomics conditions.},

Two accelerometers were used to identify the body posture and forward bending of the trunk during work and leisure time. The pattern of forward bending was analyzed using exposure variation analysis (EVA). The recordings comprised of 2.6~$\pm$~0.97 working days in average, with 19.9~$\pm$~8.1~h work and 22.9~$\pm$~8.9~h leisure. The standard deviation and entropy of the EVA profile indicated 11\% and 6\% (for about 80\% of subjects) less variable pattern during work compared with the leisure time, respectively. These new findings contribute to the understanding the paradoxical outcomes of PA during work and leisure.},

Alterations in trunk and pelvis kinematics may also be involved in ACL injury. Although some studies have compared the effects of muscle fatigue on lower limb kinematics between men and women, little is known about its effects on pelvis and trunk kinematics. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of fatigue on lower limb, pelvis and trunk kinematics and muscle activation between men and women during landing.
METHODS: The participants included forty healthy subjects. We performed kinematic analysis of the trunk, pelvis, hip and knee and muscle activation analysis of the gluteal muscles, vastus lateralis and biceps femoris, during a single-leg landing before and after fatigue.
RESULTS: Men had greater trunk flexion than women after fatigue. After fatigue, a decrease in peak knee flexion and an increase in Gmax and BF activation were observed.
CONCLUSION: The increase in the trunk flexion can decrease the anterior tibiofemoral shear force resulted from the lower knee flexion angle, thereby decreasing the stress on the ACL.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate, first, the influence of task variation on electromyographic (EMG) manifestations of shoulder muscle fatigue and discomfort; second, noticeable postural shoulder changes over time; third, if the association between task variation and EMG might be biased by postural changes. Outcome parameters were recorded using multichannel EMG, Optotrak and the Borg scale. Fourteen participants performed a one-hour repetitive Pegboard task in one continuous and two interrupted conditions with rest and a pick-and-place task, respectively. Manifestations of shoulder muscle fatigue and discomfort feelings were observed throughout the conditions but these were not significantly influenced by task variation. After correction for joint angles, the relation between task variation and EMG was significantly biased but significant effects of task variation remained absent.
PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: Comparing a one-hour continuous, repetitive Pegboard task with two interrupted conditions revealed no significant influences of task variation. We did observe that the relation between task variation and EMG was biased by posture and therefore advise taking account for posture when investigating manifestations of muscle fatigue in assembly tasks.},

  abstract = {Repetitive low-force contractions are common in the workplace and yet can lead to muscle fatigue and work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The current study aimed to investigate potential motion adaptations during a simulated repetitive light assembly work task designed to fatigue the shoulder region, focusing on changes over time and age-related group differences. Ten younger and ten older participants performed four 20-min task sessions separated by short breaks. Mean and variability of joint angles and scapular elevation, joint net moments for the shoulder, elbow, and wrist were calculated from upper extremity kinematics recorded by a motion tracking system. Results showed that joint angle and joint torque decreased across sessions and across multiple joints and segments. Increased kinematic variability over time was observed in the shoulder joint; however, decreased kinematic variability over time was seen in the more distal part of the upper limb. The changes of motion adaptations were sensitive to the task-break schedule. The results suggested that kinematic and kinetic adaptations occurred to reduce the biomechanical loading on the fatigued shoulder region. In addition, the kinematic and kinetic responses at the elbow and wrist joints also changed, possibly to compensate for the increased variability caused by the shoulder joint while still maintaining task requirements. These motion strategies in responses to muscle fatigue were similar between two age groups although the older group showed more effort in adaptation than the younger in terms of magnitude and affected body parts.},

METHODS: WorkSafe Victoria (Australia) workers' compensation data (254,704 claims with affliction onset 2004-2011) were analysed. Claim rates were calculated by combining compensation data with state-wide employment data.
RESULTS: Mental disorder claim rates were 1.9 times higher among women; physical injury claim rates were 1.4 times higher among men. Adjusting for occupational group reversed the gender difference in musculoskeletal and tendon injury claim rates, i.e., these were more common in women than men after adjusting for occupational exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Men had higher rates of physical injury claims than women, but this was mostly attributable to occupational factors. Women had higher rates of mental disorder claims than men; this was not fully explained by industry or occupation.},
