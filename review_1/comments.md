# Reviewer 1

## Question 1
It is recommended for Figure 1 to be introduced earlier in the Experimental Procedures section so that the reader has the image of the lifting task in mind while reading the remainder of the Methods.

## Question 2
Why was this statistical method selected?
More details should be provided on statistical parametric mapping to explain its appropriateness for this type of data and the benefit over other waveform analysis approaches such as PCA.

## Question 3
Page 10: the panel locations introduced for Figure 4 are opposite to the figure.

## Question 4
Page 11: The differences mentioned for the glenohumeral joint are from 54-71%, but elsewhere it was mentioned that the interaction was only for 55-72%?

## Question 5
The color images are difficult to distinguish when in black and white.
Can a secondary distinguishing feature be used in the figures to indicate the differences?

## Question 6
Portions of the 2 separate paragraphs for Post-Hoc Analysis seem repetitive and contradictory.
In the first it says there was only a difference for women, then in the second, differences are described for men as well.

## Question 7
The authors should provide a description of some of the limitations for the study in the Discussion.

# Reviewer 2

## Question 1
Page 2 - line 8: Please specify the type of injury (e.g., joint injuries)

## Question 2
Page 4 - line 4-10: Please also refer to following studies wherein sex differences (Lindbeck and Kjellberg, 2001) in lifting kinematics as well as sex and age differences (Shojaei et al., 2016) in both kinematics and kinetics were investigated:
1) Gender differences in lifting technique
2) Age related differences in mechanical demands imposed on the lower back by manual material handling tasks

## Question 3
Page 5 - line 41: “Each participant used the two masses (6 and 12 kg)” can be combined with the sentence in line 25-26.

## Question 4
Page 5 - line 54: Was it required to instruct the subjects to minimize the movement of lower limbs?
I mean was not it more natural otherwise?

## Question 5
Page 6 - line 52-57: In introducing DoFs of the kinematics model a mixture of segments (e.g., pelvis and trunk) and joints (e.g., elbow and wrist) has been used that seems not to be consistent and appropriate.

## Question 6
Page 7 - line 13: What is q in reference configuration standing for?

## Question 7
Page 7 - line 23-28: Only one axis for the wrist local coordinate system has been introduced while at least two axes are required.

## Question 8
Page 7-8: How joint rotations were calculated (e.g., quaternion?). Did you then use sequential rotations?
If so, what sequence you used (e.g., Cardan sequence?)
Please include figure numbers in your figure captions.

## Question 9 (optional)
Page 8 - line 47-48: I think a two way ANOVA with repeated measure on one factor is simply called a mixed ANOVA (Also, mixed model ANOVA or mixed factorial ANOVA). You may improve it.

## Question 10 (optional)
Two fixed (i.e., not normalized) loads of 6 kg and 12 kg were used for all participants regardless of body weight.
While it makes sense from the point that workplace loads are not gender-specific, it may confound the sex-related differences.
What the authors think?
Specifically regarding the findings from the correlation results “when the mass of the box represents a greater proportion of the participant’s mass (the participant is lighter or the box is heavier), there is no change among men while women use more the wrist and elbow joints and less the glenohumeral joint.”
